<h1>THE SECRET OF THE SUNDIAL</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br /><i>An Initiation</i></h2>
<p>On a certain evening in early September&mdash;Friday
the thirteenth&mdash;to be exact, a stranger in Claymore,
Michigan, might have been startled to behold
two figures, grotesque in long white sheets which
draped them from head to foot, scurrying along
an alley leading to Summit Street. It was an appropriate
night for ghosts to be abroad. The
moon was in the dark and the wind whistled
weirdly through the trees.</p>
<p>The two figures moved stealthily along the boxwood
hedge which bordered the rear of the George
Brady property. Presently, coming to an opening
barely large enough to squeeze through, they
paused, glancing hastily in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast is clear!&rdquo; one murmured in a low
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t expect me to crawl through
that tiny hole!&rdquo; came the indignant protest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not the bean-pole you are, Jane Allen. What&rsquo;s
the sense of all this secrecy anyhow? Why can&rsquo;t
we go in the main entrance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you want everyone to see you!&rdquo; the
other retorted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of having a secret
society if it isn&rsquo;t secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; silently acknowledged the
weight of this argument and permitted herself to
be pushed toward the opening in the hedge. Half
way through, her sheet caught. In her efforts to
free herself, it tore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s best sheet!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
I catch it when I get home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; the other urged with callous indifference
to the fate which might await her friend.
&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t be late for the initiation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved swiftly across the lawn, noting that
the large white house was entirely dark. They
paused at a side door and knocked three times.</p>
<p>Almost instantly the door opened and a third
ghost confronted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is here now except Cara Wayne,&rdquo;
she informed, &ldquo;and of course we don&rsquo;t want her
until we&rsquo;re all ready for the initiation. Aunt
Maude and Uncle George went to a bridge party
tonight so we have the house to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led them through darkened halls to an attic
&ldquo;clubroom&rdquo; where an oil lamp dimly burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well take off these hot sheets until
Cara comes,&rdquo; she invited. &ldquo;We can slip them on
again when we hear her at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>By way of example, she tossed off her own disguise
and stood revealed as Madge Sterling, president
of the Skull and Crossbones, a most exclusive
secret society. She was an attractive girl,
vivacious and distinctly a leader. Her laughter was
infectious; without half trying she had a way of
drawing friends to her. Older people said she had
&ldquo;tact&rdquo; but girls her own age liked her because she
was known as a good sport. Madge&rsquo;s mother was
dead, and since the disappearance of her father,
she had made her home with her aunt and uncle,
Mr. and Mrs. Brady.</p>
<p>The two newcomers were Jane Allen and Edna
Raynard. Jane was homely and very outspoken;
she made enemies easily yet was a loyal friend.
She did not mind her straight black hair or somewhat
muddy complexion. Her slender figure was
often ridiculed, but she took it all in good fun.
Edna was quite the opposite. She was pretty as a
picture, plump, and had an inclination toward
taking life exactly as she found it.</p>
<p>The other girl, Enid Burnett, was Madge&rsquo;s special
chum. Largely through Madge&rsquo;s influence,
she had been induced to come from another state to
attend the Everetts School for Girls at Claymore.
Her mother also was dead, and her father, a well-to-do
collector and sportsman, permitted her an
unusual amount of freedom. Notwithstanding,
she was a quiet, unspoiled girl with a genuine liking
for school and studies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is everything all set for the initiation, Madge?&rdquo;
Jane inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Enid and I fixed up the basement this
afternoon. We didn&rsquo;t dare let Aunt Maude know
what we were about for fear she&rsquo;d put a stop to it.
Wait until Cara steps into the tub of water! We
bought a nice big piece of quivery liver too that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off as three loud knocks sounded from
below, and made a dive for her sheet. The others
scrambled into their costumes, preparing to follow
her downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, girls, don&rsquo;t speak a word until Cara
is brought up here,&rdquo; she warned in a whisper.
&ldquo;This initiation must be a very solemn affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought up the main stunt?&rdquo; Edna
asked anxiously. &ldquo;I tried to think up something
but couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I have a hair raiser!&rdquo; Madge
chuckled.</p>
<p>She led the procession down the stairs. The
girls lined up on either side of the door and then
Madge opened it to confront a very frightened
little girl who awaited admittance in fear and
trembling. She giggled nervously as Madge
beckoned her to follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Cara Wayne was conducted by a devious route
through the dark house to the basement stairs.
Madge signified that she was to go down alone.
Cara hesitated, sensing that some unpleasant ordeal
awaited her below, but there was no escape.
She went boldly down. Suddenly, the girls heard
a little squeal of fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have touched the liver,&rdquo; Enid whispered.
&ldquo;I hung it where she couldn&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next there was a loud crash as Cara stepped
into an empty packing box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she doesn&rsquo;t miss the tub of water,&rdquo;
Madge murmured anxiously.</p>
<p>Cara did not disappoint them. A minute later
they heard a great splash and a howl of anguish.
Since the water ordeal exhausted the possibilities
of the basement, Enid was sent down to bring
up the unhappy victim. Cara was drenched to the
knees but she displayed a studied cheerfulness.
They led her to the attic clubroom, seating themselves
in a semi-circle about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cara Wayne, do you promise never to reveal
anything which transpires here this night?&rdquo; Madge
asked in a deep, sepulchre-like voice.</p>
<p>There was a long silence and then Cara&rsquo;s quavering:
&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you obey any command given you
during the next week by any illustrious member
of Skull and Crossbones?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Cara promised, visions of many detested
tasks passing before her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, one last test of your courage remains
to be made,&rdquo; Madge continued impressively. &ldquo;It
lacks twenty minutes of midnight. Exactly upon
the hour you must go to the old boarded-up
Swenster mansion, bringing back some token to
prove that you have accomplished your mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute Cara looked as though she intended
to refuse, and in truth, the others could not have
blamed her. The old Swenster mansion was several
doors away, adjoining a grove of pine trees
which at night was not the most pleasant place to
pass. The Swenster grounds were surrounded by
a high fence and hedge which hid the house from
view of the street. The place had been closed
for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I can get into the grounds,&rdquo;
Cara protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go in the back way,&rdquo; Madge informed,
forgetting her pose and speaking in a natural
voice. &ldquo;It will take you some time to reach there,
so you had better start now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara looked very unhappy but she knew that
to refuse might mean her dismissal from the organization
to which she aspired. Reluctantly, she
made her way down the dark stairs. The outside
door closed behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was an inspiration!&rdquo; Enid praised after
Cara had gone. &ldquo;Madge, you have such clever
ideas! I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d do it, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cara&rsquo;s game,&rdquo; Madge laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not enjoy
going to the Swenster mansion myself at this time
of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t hire me to go near there,&rdquo; Edna
added feelingly. &ldquo;I can just see poor Cara shaking
in her boots. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll be able to get
into the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate at the rear is ajar,&rdquo; Madge returned.
&ldquo;I tested it this afternoon to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some minutes the girls laughed over the
evening&rsquo;s fun. Shortly after midnight they began
to expect Cara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she&rsquo;d hurry,&rdquo; Madge said. &ldquo;Aunt
Maude and Uncle George will be coming home
soon and that will put an end to the initiation.
She&rsquo;s had plenty of time to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes past midnight, the girls were
a little alarmed. They cast off their cumbersome
robes and went downstairs to watch for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; Madge worried.
&ldquo;Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have sent her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably trying to worry us just to get
even,&rdquo; Jane insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go to the Swenster mansion
and see what is keeping her,&rdquo; Madge returned
quietly. &ldquo;Or if you like, I&rsquo;ll go alone. It was my
idea in the first place&mdash;a bum one I&rsquo;ll admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Enid commanded. &ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;s
coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all turned to look and saw a figure fairly
flying down the street toward the house. She
hurled herself through the gate and raced across
the yard. Before the girls could open the door,
she flung herself against it, crying: &ldquo;Let me in!
Let me in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they hurriedly admitted her, she stumbled
against Madge, gripping her in a nervous embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bring the token?&rdquo; they asked her.</p>
<p>Cara laughed hysterically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t bring it but I went to the Swenster
mansion all right! And I don&rsquo;t care what you
say&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not go back! Not even if it means staying
out of the club. Nothing can make me go
near that horrible place again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br /><i>Cara&rsquo;s Fright</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you didn&rsquo;t bring a token,&rdquo;
Madge comforted the shaking Cara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not
make you go back there again. But tell us, what
frightened you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I saw a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have dreamed it,&rdquo; Jane declared.
&ldquo;I guess you saw so many ghosts during the initiation
that you had them on your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara shook her head stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t dream this. I saw something
white moving around in the Swenster yard&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what it could have been if it wasn&rsquo;t
a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge switched on the living room lights and
led Cara to a chair. The girls were disturbed to
see that she was pale. No one doubted that her
fright was genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cara Wayne, you know very well that ghosts
don&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; Madge said sternly. &ldquo;Now tell us
exactly what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I went to the old mansion as I was told
to do. I went around the back way and found
the gate ajar. Believe me, I wasn&rsquo;t very keen to
go inside, but I made myself do it. No sooner
had I stepped inside than I saw the thing&mdash;oh,
it was awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did it look like?&rdquo; Edna demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just saw something white and a face&mdash;it
frightened me so I turned and ran. I made it
back here in about thirty seconds flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your so called ghost doing in the
Swenster yard?&rdquo; Madge questioned curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Digging with a shovel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until now the girls had been impressed with
Cara&rsquo;s story although they took no stock in ghosts,
but this announcement called forth gales of
laughter in which all joined save Madge. She
had begun to think that perhaps Cara&rsquo;s fright
was based upon something more substantial than
imagination. She kept the thought to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been seeing things!&rdquo; Jane
scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t believe me, go there yourself
and find out!&rdquo; Cara challenged.</p>
<p>Madge tactfully put an end to the argument
by suggesting that refreshments be served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all had enough initiation for one night,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I vote that without further ceremony
we make Cara a full-fledged member of the club.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The others unanimously agreed. Cara breathed
a deep sigh of relief as she realized that it was all
over. Madge and Enid went to the kitchen to
dish up ice cream and cake. Everyone was very
sweet to Cara, trying to atone for the unpleasant
events of the evening. She bore no one a grudge
and soon was able to laugh at her own experience.</p>
<p>Before the girls had finished their ice cream, Mr.
and Mrs. Brady returned home from the bridge
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, not a word about what happened,&rdquo;
Jane warned as footsteps were heard on the porch.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Brady greeted the girls cordially.
Themselves youthful in spirit, they enjoyed the
society of young people and never objected when
Madge overran the house with her friends. If
they noticed that Cara looked pale and slightly ill
at ease, they made no mention of it.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the girls departed, gratefully
accepting Mr. Brady&rsquo;s offer to drive them
home in his car. Madge had hoped to speak alone
with Cara before she left, but the opportunity did
not present itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see her tomorrow at school,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;I mean to find out more about what happened
tonight at the Swenster mansion. Cara isn&rsquo;t the
sort to be frightened over nothing. I&rsquo;m inclined
to think something queer may be going on there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Madge had a certain instinct for adventure;
her many thrilling experiences were the envy of
her friends. Each summer she was privileged to
spend many pleasant months at her uncle&rsquo;s fishing
lodge at Loon Lake, Canada. There she had met
Jack French, a young forest ranger, who had taken
more than an ordinary interest in her. Her friendship
for an orphan, Anne Fairaday, had plunged
her into a baffling search for a valuable paper. The
story of this interesting adventure is related in
the first volume of the Madge Sterling series, entitled
&ldquo;<i>The Missing Formula</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More recently, she had been involved in a strange
kidnapping case. Arriving at Cheltham Bay to
visit her friend Enid, she had found the Burnett
yacht abandoned. In trying to discover what became
of Mr. Burnett she was brought into dangerous
contact with a fanatical group of Zudi Drum
worshipers. This story is recounted in the volume
&ldquo;<i>The Deserted Yacht</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered why the Swenster mansion
has been kept boarded up all these years,&rdquo; Madge
reflected as she undressed for bed. &ldquo;It must have
been quite a show place at one time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still thinking of the old estate when
she tumbled into bed. Perhaps Cara&rsquo;s tale of
&ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; had disturbed her more than she knew
for her dreams were of the wildest sort. It seemed
to her that she had slept half the night when she
was awakened by a loud cry from the basement.
Actually, she had been asleep only a few minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she asked herself nervously,
sitting up in bed. &ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t a burglar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound was not repeated but she could hear
something banging about in the basement. After
a moment of indecision she decided to investigate.
Slipping into her bathrobe, she stole softly down
the stairway. She could hear someone coming up
the basement steps and scarcely knew whether to
retreat or stand her ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly the cellar door was flung open and
Uncle George stomped angrily into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who left a tub of water at the foot of the
stairs?&rdquo; he demanded crossly. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight struck Madge as extremely funny and
she made the mistake of laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is your idea of a joke&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Brady
began threateningly.</p>
<p>Madge hastily assured him that the tub of water
had not been intended for him, but it was some time
before she could clear herself. She finally coaxed
him into a better humor and left him foraging contentedly
in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>The next day she did not forget her resolution
to question Cara Wayne. During algebra class,
when the teacher&rsquo;s back was turned, she passed a
note, asking Cara to wait for her after school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me more about the Swenster
ghost,&rdquo; Madge commanded as they linked arms
and started away from the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I suppose I&rsquo;ll never hear the last of
it,&rdquo; Cara sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to admit it couldn&rsquo;t
have been a ghost, but there was somebody in
that yard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a splendid idea!&rdquo; Madge confided,
watching her friend mischievously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to
the old mansion now and see what we can discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara shrank away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I don&rsquo;t care for the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s broad daylight,&rdquo; Madge insisted. &ldquo;And
remember, for a week you&rsquo;re supposed to obey the
commands of any member of Skull and Crossbones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Cara submitted unwillingly,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what you expect to find there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not respond. In truth, she could not
have told what she hoped to learn. It was pure
intuition that had inspired the little adventure.
Turning down Summit Street, she urged Cara to
a faster pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so glum,&rdquo; she protested gayly. &ldquo;It
will be fun! Before we&rsquo;re through, I&rsquo;ll warrant
you&rsquo;ll be glad I brought you along!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br /><i>The Swenster Mansion</i></h2>
<p>The Swenster mansion was a large, rambling
affair, set back some distance from the other modern
dwellings on Summit Street. A high, untrimmed
hedge at the front and large evergreen
trees hid the grounds from view. The windows
had been boarded up for years and most persons
could not recall when the house had been occupied.
It had fast fallen into decay. Shutters dangled
loosely on rusty hinges, weeds choked the lawn,
everything needed paint. Yet, with the passing
years, the old mansion had retained something of
its former elegance.</p>
<p>Madge and Cara paused briefly to survey the
place from the front, then walked swiftly around
to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may get into trouble if we&rsquo;re caught trespassing,&rdquo;
Cara ventured timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that when the owner hasn&rsquo;t been
heard from in years,&rdquo; Madge returned, undisturbed.
She rattled the back gate and was surprised
to find it locked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer. It was
unfastened yesterday afternoon when I stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t locked last night,&rdquo; Cara added with
growing uneasiness. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not try to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge was not to be so easily discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can climb over easy as scat!&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if someone should see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them. At the worst, we can only be run
out. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swung over the fence with an ease which
her friend could not hope to duplicate. Still protesting,
Cara permitted herself to be helped over.</p>
<p>Madge looked about the grounds with keen interest.
A winding walk led to a tangled, overgrown
rose garden. She saw a tiny cement pool,
clogged with old dead leaves and sticks. Beyond,
a sundial of peculiar design and construction, attracted
her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it quaint!&rdquo; she exclaimed admiringly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can tell what time it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cara insisted. &ldquo;I never could
make head nor tail of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dial rested upon a concrete pedestal which
reached waist high when the girls stood beside it.
Upon the brass face appeared slightly raised
Roman numerals and the triangular gnomon cast
its shadow across the four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little after four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Madge
announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a safe guess,&rdquo; Cara laughed. &ldquo;You
know school lets out at ten till.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to guess with a sundial such as
this. Half of them won&rsquo;t tell time accurately.
That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re turned out at the factory
and sent all over the country. To be accurate a
sundial must be made especially for the section
where it is used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one does look home made,&rdquo; Cara acknowledged.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice work though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge would have enjoyed wandering about in
the garden but she could tell that her friend was
eager to get away. Reluctantly, she gave her attention
to the matter which had drawn her to the
mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where it was that you saw your ghost,&rdquo;
she commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a dozen paces from where we&rsquo;re
standing. Someone was digging here in the
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Madge carefully studied the
ground. She paused a short distance from the
sundial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s loose earth here,&rdquo; she announced, stirring
it with the toe of her shoe. &ldquo;I guess you were
right about seeing someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I was right. I hope you don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;m afraid of my shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Cara. I wonder who could have
been digging here and for what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe someone was burying a dead cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks don&rsquo;t go to other people&rsquo;s yards to bury
their pets. Think of a better reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; Cara cried promptly. &ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;s
a treasure hidden here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think so, but I&rsquo;m afraid that only
happens in story books. Cara, what did your
ghost do when he saw you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he saw me at all. Anyway, I
didn&rsquo;t wait long enough to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge examined the loose earth but as she had
no implement with which to dig, was unable to tell
whether or not anything had been buried. Cara
displayed slight interest and moved away. Madge
completely forgot her until she came back dragging
a spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, if you must dig around in the dirt, use
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge seized upon the tool, demanding to know
where it had been discovered.</p>
<p>Cara indicated a large lilac bush only a few feet
away. &ldquo;I found it beneath the branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the shovel your ghost was using
last night! See, there&rsquo;s a little dirt still on it. If
it had been lying there long, it would be rusty.
Cara, I&rsquo;ll wager a cent&mdash;a good Indian cent&mdash;that
you frightened someone away from here last
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was mutual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the person who hid this shovel intends
to come back again,&rdquo; Madge went on reflectively.
&ldquo;Now what I can&rsquo;t understand is why anyone
would come to a boarded-up mansion at midnight
to dig up the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara, who was not particularly imaginative,
could not suggest a possible explanation. She
watched with hopeful interest as her friend began
to turn up the loose earth. After Madge had dug
for fifteen minutes she decided it was not worth
the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! I&rsquo;m convinced there&rsquo;s nothing hidden
here. And if anyone should find us digging up
the yard it might be hard to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She carefully repacked the soil in the hole, and
then to Cara&rsquo;s wonderment, returned the spade to
the place where it had been found under the lilac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why take such pains?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want your &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; to know
we&rsquo;ve used his spade,&rdquo; Madge explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
curious to learn what there is worth digging for
in this yard. I mean to find out too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how do you propose to go about it?&rdquo; Cara
questioned skeptically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by keeping my eyes and ears open. You
can tell that whoever was here last night didn&rsquo;t care
to be observed. It&rsquo;s my opinion he&rsquo;ll come back
to do some more digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he does, the occasion will be conspicuous
for my absence,&rdquo; Cara declared feelingly.</p>
<p>She glanced at her wrist watch and flashed it
before her friend&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what time it is? I must be getting
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge gazed regretfully toward the boarded-up
house and wished that she might at least peep
inside to see what secrets it guarded. It would be
relatively simple to pry loose a board, but of course
she had no intention of ever doing that. As it
was, she felt somewhat guilty because she had
trespassed.</p>
<p>She followed Cara to the gate and after looking
about to see that the alley was deserted, climbed
over. They walked thoughtfully toward their
homes, parting at the Wayne residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep this little affair under your hat,&rdquo;
Madge advised. &ldquo;If you do, we may be able to
have some fun out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; Cara promised. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re
planning any midnight visits to the mansion or
anything of the kind, count me out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Madge laughed and turned away. Already she
was planning another trip to the old mansion, but
she thought it wise not to mention it just yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It behooves me to learn a few facts about the
Swensters before I jump to hasty conclusions,&rdquo;
she told herself, as she continued home. &ldquo;Between
now and my next visit, I must unearth the family
history.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br /><i>The Swenster Pearls</i></h2>
<p>School did not keep the following day, and
early afternoon found Madge and Cara camped on
the Brady front porch, comparing notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t learn a thing about the Swenster
mansion except that it&rsquo;s owned by an old lady who
hasn&rsquo;t been near the place in years,&rdquo; the latter confessed
regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My luck wasn&rsquo;t a great deal better,&rdquo; Madge
admitted. &ldquo;However, I did find out the name of a
woman who may be able to tell us what we want
to know. Her name is Hilda Grandale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I heard of her before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. She&rsquo;s a real old lady&mdash;eighty or
ninety. She is reputed to know all the old residents
of the town and their histories. In her day she
was considered quite a belle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the catch. She moved to the country a
few years ago. She&rsquo;s living on a farm with her
sister. It&rsquo;s in Cahoun County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to scratch her off our list.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Uncle George might be persuaded
to loan us his coupe. We could drive out
there in a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea seemed an excellent one so the girls
went to search for Mr. Brady. They found him in
the back yard washing the car. With shrewd calculation
they snatched up rags and aided him in
polishing the nickel work. Mr. Brady eyed them
somewhat suspiciously and was not surprised when
Madge inquired: &ldquo;By the way, Uncle George, will
you need your old hack for a few hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for that, I&rsquo;ll not let you have it,&rdquo; he told
her sternly, but the next minute he smiled and
turned over the keys.</p>
<p>Madge backed the coupe out the driveway,
missed a telephone pole by scant inches, and sped
down the street. She took a main highway out of
the city and soon was in open country. Having
previously inquired the way, she thought they
would have no difficulty in finding the farmhouse
where Hilda Grandale lived. Soon after the
speedometer registered thirty miles, Cara spied the
name for which they searched upon a roadside
mailbox.</p>
<p>The gate was open and they drove into the barn
yard. Squawking chickens darted to safety and a
flock of geese waddled off hissing their protest.
The commotion proclaimed their approach, and as
the girls halted the car, a woman peered out the
kitchen door. She hastily straightened her hair
and came down the walk to meet them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Madge stated their mission, saying that they
wished to visit Mrs. Grandale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure Mother is awake,&rdquo; the woman returned
doubtfully. &ldquo;She usually takes a nap about
this time. But if she&rsquo;s up I know she&rsquo;ll be glad to
see you. She does enjoy company and so few
people ever get out this far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the girls to the house, seating them in
a prim, old fashioned living room. They begged
her not to disturb Mrs. Grandale, but she went
upstairs, returning to say that her mother was
awake and would be down shortly.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, the old lady came slowly down
the stairs. She was dressed in severe black, with
a long full skirt which swept the floor, and wore a
white lace cap. Her face was wrinkled and sunken
but her eyes were as bright as those of a young
girl. She beamed kindly upon Madge and Cara
as they arose to greet her. They did not offer to
help her to a chair for they guessed that she was
proud of her ability to get around by herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, do I know your names?&rdquo; she inquired,
studying their faces intently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
the Sterling girl, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Madge acknowledged in astonishment.
She never before had met Mrs. Grandale.
&ldquo;How did you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; the old lady cackled in delight.
&ldquo;I could tell those features anywhere. I used to
know your father, my dear, and you&rsquo;re the picture
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge looked a trifle embarrassed at the reference
to her father. His name was seldom mentioned
in the Brady household although no disgrace
was attached to his memory. He had simply disappeared
when Madge was a child, and no one
had ever heard of him again. Some day she hoped
to learn what had taken him away from Claymore,
but at the present she preferred that Mrs. Grandale
not dwell upon the subject.</p>
<p>She introduced Cara Wayne, and for a time it
was next to impossible for the girls to get a word
in edgewise, as Mrs. Grandale immediately went
into a long monologue on the subject of the Wayne
family history. By concerted action they finally
managed to switch the subject to the Swenster
mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my day, it was <i>the</i> house of Claymore,&rdquo; Mrs.
Grandale declared. &ldquo;And what a pity that it has
fallen into decay! Not that folks didn&rsquo;t say the
Swensters would rue the day they built it&mdash;it was
much too fine for the city even in prosperous
times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the Swensters,&rdquo; Madge encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were a proud family,&rdquo; the old lady ruminated,
obviously relishing the tale. &ldquo;At one time,
old Mr. Swenster practically ran the town. His
daughters were in society and they thought the
world depended upon the swish of their skirts. At
least Florence did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many girls were there?&rdquo; Cara asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two. Rose and Florence. Rose was the
younger and the favorite with her father. She
was a pretty thing too. Far too handsome to suit
Florence. I think I have a picture somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind,&rdquo; Madge said hastily. She
was interested in the story which she felt Mrs.
Grandale was on the verge of telling, and did not
wish her to digress lest she forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was I saying? Oh, yes, Rose and
Florence were rivals and they were both anxious
to get their hands on the Swenster pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard about them,&rdquo; Madge remarked.
&ldquo;Were they valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were reputed to be worth a small fortune.
The pearls had been bought abroad generations before
and were perfectly matched. They were to
be passed down to the eldest daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Florence was to have them,&rdquo; Cara observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;According to custom, yes. But that was what
caused all the trouble. During his lifetime, old
Mr. Swenster permitted the girls to take turns
wearing the pearls. They were very jealous of
their father&rsquo;s favor in regard to the privilege, or
so rumor had it. Florence thought the pearls were
hers and resented having her sister even wear
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Swenster died and when his will was
read, the daughters had the surprise of their lives.
It was learned that he had left the pearls to his
favorite, Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have stirred up trouble,&rdquo; Madge
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Florence considered it a great injustice.
She claimed she had been cheated out of her rightful
inheritance. For a time, there was a disgraceful
fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose kept the pearls?&rdquo; Madge questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was generally believed, but I doubt if anyone
ever knew for certain. The matter was suddenly
hushed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grandale relapsed into a meditative silence,
seeming to forget the girls. Then she said, half
to herself: &ldquo;No one ever saw Rose wear the
pearls&mdash;that was the odd part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were Rose and Florence friends after that?&rdquo;
Cara probed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They went about together but it was apparent
things were not as should be between two sisters.
Everyone said the pearls brought them misfortune.
At any rate, Florence died the following
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how dreadful,&rdquo; Cara murmured. &ldquo;How
poor Rose must have felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She dropped out of society after that,&rdquo; Mrs.
Grandale returned. &ldquo;For years, she lived alone
at the old mansion and then one day, she up and
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t living now, of course?&rdquo; Madge inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she died young&mdash;shortly after her
daughter was born. The little girl was called
Agatha. She&rsquo;s the last of the Swenster line now,
and they say the estate has dwindled to almost
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of Agatha Swenster?&rdquo; Cara
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t exactly say,&rdquo; the old lady responded,
frowning thoughtfully. &ldquo;She lived in
Claymore until eight years ago and then closed up
the place because she couldn&rsquo;t afford to keep such
a large house open. She went to another town,
but where, I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say she&rsquo;s the last of the Swenster line,&rdquo;
Madge prompted as Mrs. Grandale appeared to
have ended her story. &ldquo;She never married?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge. She did have an adopted
boy. Let me think&mdash;no, I can&rsquo;t recall his name.
He turned out badly. Agatha thought a lot of
him and folks said it most broke her heart when
he got into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; Cara questioned curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. The Swensters always
kept their troubles to themselves. I do know that
it was something that turned Agatha against him.
They separated, and after that she closed up her
house. It may have been because of money or
perhaps on account of the boy. At any rate, she&rsquo;s
having a hard time of it now like as not. She&rsquo;s
getting on in years and with no one to support her,
it must be trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you imagine became of the pearls?&rdquo;
Madge asked suddenly.</p>
<p>The old lady smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine they were sold years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had learned all there was to know
concerning the Swenster mansion and its former
occupants, but they lingered a half hour longer,
before saying goodbye to Mrs. Grandale. Before
they left, her daughter appeared from the kitchen
with fresh-baked cake and a cool beverage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Delightful people,&rdquo; Cara observed as they
drove away. &ldquo;And did you ever hear anyone more
talkative than Mrs. Grandale? She&rsquo;s a walking
encyclopaedia of Claymore&rsquo;s history. Did you
learn what you wanted to know, Madge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned enough to make me more interested
than ever in the old mansion. Strange about those
pearls, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they turned out to be a sort of family
hoodoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they were actually sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara stared at her friend in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Grandale said they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only her opinion,&rdquo; Madge corrected.
&ldquo;Of course, I have no reason for thinking the
pearls weren&rsquo;t sold. I was merely wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed into moody silence and did not
broach the subject again during the ride back to
Claymore. They had remained at the farmhouse
longer than they had planned and it was nearly
supper time when they reached the city. Cara requested
Madge to drop her off at the Wayne home
which was not out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be busy tonight?&rdquo; Madge inquired
as she halted the car in front of the Wayne residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we might do a little sleuthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something in connection with the Swenster
mansion?&rdquo; Cara demanded suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a notion to go there tonight and
watch. It would be fun to see if that man comes
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; Cara snorted. &ldquo;I have other ideas of
amusement. Count me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t come, I suppose I can get
Jane or Enid,&rdquo; Madge said shrewdly.</p>
<p>Cara visibly wavered. She had no desire to go
near the Swenster mansion again, but neither could
she bear to have Enid or Jane sharing in an adventure
which was hers for the taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she gave in. &ldquo;If I can get away,
I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet me at the pine grove at nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
Madge directed, as she shifted gears. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
fail to come. Something exciting may break!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br /><i>Madge Turns Sleuth</i></h2>
<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock found Madge waiting at the pine
grove which adjoined the Swenster Mansion. She
stationed herself near a street lamp where Cara
could not fail to see her. Ten minutes elapsed,
then fifteen.</p>
<p>Glancing impatiently at her watch, Madge decided
it was useless to wait longer for her friend.
Slowly she walked on toward the mansion.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a shout from behind, and
turned to see Cara running after her. She was
out of breath by the time she caught up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to be so late,&rdquo; she apologized. &ldquo;I was
afraid I&rsquo;d not get away at all. Mother and Dad
were going to an ice cream social and didn&rsquo;t see
any reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t go along. I&rsquo;ll not
dare stay out later than eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither will I. Let&rsquo;s hope something interesting
happens before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really expect anything, but I&rsquo;d like very
much to learn the identity of your strange ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>The girls slipped into a side street leading to
the rear of the mansion. They found the gate
locked and since they were unable to work the
trick catch, were forced to climb over again.</p>
<p>Under the soft, weird light of the moon, the
Swenster mansion looked far different than by
daylight. Even Madge was willing to admit there
was something sinister about the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the spade is still here?&rdquo; she thought
aloud.</p>
<p>They found it under the lilac bush, but not in
the exact place where they had left it on the previous
visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has used it again!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed.
&ldquo;Oh, I wish we had watched last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cara said nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not keen on watching tonight either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge paid not the slightest attention to her
friend&rsquo;s gentle hints that they leave. She surveyed
the garden, looking for a suitable hiding
place. A huge rhododendron bush offered a possibility
and she went over to examine it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will serve nicely,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be well hidden, and if necessary we can probably
slip out the front way without being seen by anyone
in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Cara allowed herself to be dragged under the
rhododendron although secretly she felt that it
was a silly and undignified thing to do. She sank
down on the ground gingerly, fearing to soil her
silk frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better make yourself comfortable,&rdquo; Madge advised
cheerfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re likely to be here a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prediction came true with a vengeance.
Minutes dragged like hours. The girls talked for
a time, but soon exhausted all topics of conversation.
Their limbs became cramped and they shifted
from one position to another. Cara yawned several
times and once dozed off for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it most eleven?&rdquo; she asked hopefully. &ldquo;I
must be home by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge looked at her watch which she could
plainly see under the bright moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here only a little more than an
hour,&rdquo; she informed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to go home
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara sighed and shifted to a new position. The
adventure had lost all its original thrill and terror.
It was deadly monotonous to lie there watching for
something which likely never would come. Madge
cheered her friend with good natured &ldquo;kidding,&rdquo;
but she too was beginning to wonder if they had
not wasted the evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; Cara said presently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care what time it is, I&rsquo;ve had about enough. Even
the ice cream social would have been more fun
than this. I&rsquo;ll be surprised if I can walk in the
morning&mdash;every muscle in my poor body is lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Madge gave in reluctantly. &ldquo;I
suppose we may as well call it a night. Not much
chance&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off, grasping Cara by the
hand. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she whispered tensely. &ldquo;Someone
<i>is</i> coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara turned her head to gaze toward the rear
gate. Cold chills raced down her spine. A man
was standing at the fence, and she was certain
it was the same person she had seen on the night
of the initiation. He wore a white sweater which
evidently had been the one thing that had impressed
her before. At the time she had been so frightened
that it had registered upon her mind as &ldquo;something
white&rdquo; and she had jumped to the conclusion that
a ghost was abroad.</p>
<p>The man looked quickly about in all directions,
then unfastened the gate and entered the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here before all right,&rdquo; Cara whispered,
&ldquo;or he wouldn&rsquo;t know how to get that gate
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Madge warned.</p>
<p>She had not taken her eyes from the man. He
walked directly to the lilac bush and picked up the
spade. He was still too far away for her to see
his face plainly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>The girls watched breathlessly as he walked
slowly into the garden, pausing a short distance
from the sundial. They saw him gaze thoughtfully
about, and then he began to turn up the earth
with his spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not digging where he did before,&rdquo; Cara
whispered. &ldquo;I wish he would turn this way so we
could see his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Madge warned her friend to be silent,
and they crouched motionless, watching, for perhaps
ten minutes the man spaded steadily. Then
with an exclamation of impatience, he refilled the
hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he crazy?&rdquo; Cara whispered, forgetting the
admonition to remain silent.</p>
<p>Madge shook her head to show that the man&rsquo;s
actions were a complete mystery to her.</p>
<p>The man rested a few minutes, and with his back
still toward the rhododendron bush, then began
to excavate another hole, only a few feet from the
first one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s searching for something,&rdquo; Madge
thought. &ldquo;But what in the world does he expect
to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was very curious to learn the identity of the
stranger and waited patiently until he turned
toward her. The light shone full on his face. She
had never seen him before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Madge glanced questioningly at her chum. Cara
shook her head in bewilderment. The man was a
stranger to her also.</p>
<p>It was growing late and in spite of their keen
desire to learn all there was to know, the girls
dared remain no longer. They decided to wait
until the man&rsquo;s back was turned and attempt to
slip around to the front of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re caught, it may not be so nice,&rdquo; Cara
whispered nervously.</p>
<p>They awaited their chance and softly crept from
under the bush. Scarcely had they emerged than
the man straightened, dropping his spade. It was
too late to retreat. The girls could only freeze
themselves against the foliage, praying that they
would not be seen. And at that moment, he turned
and looked directly toward the rhododendron
bush!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br /><i>The Unknown Owner</i></h2>
<p>Madge and Cara felt certain their presence in
the garden had been noted, but to their relief,
the man looked away again. He rested briefly,
then picked up his spade and resumed digging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Madge whispered the instant his back
had turned.</p>
<p>They moved noiselessly along the vine-covered
wall until they were hidden behind the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely thought we were caught that time,&rdquo;
Cara said nervously. &ldquo;What can he be after anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew. Just our luck to have to rush
home at the exciting time! He may not come here
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The front gate had been locked with padlock
and chain, but the girls found a small opening in
the side fence and slipped through. They breathed
easier as they emerged on the street. It was after
eleven o&rsquo;clock so they ran nearly all the way to
their homes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Madge did not see her friend the following day
which was Sunday. In spite of her vigorous protest,
she was herded into a neighbor&rsquo;s car and taken
on a picnic which Mr. and Mrs. Brady had promised
to attend earlier in the week. School opened
as usual on Monday, but Cara failed to appear,
and upon calling at the Wayne home that evening,
Madge found her ill in bed with a cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have caught it from sitting so long on
the ground at the Swenster Mansion,&rdquo; Cara declared.
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not going there again tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge had thought that she might, but with
Cara unable to accompany her, it scarcely seemed
fair. Then too, the old house at night was not
the most pleasant place to be alone. She readily
promised her friend the little adventure would be
postponed.</p>
<p>Cara came to school the following day but her
cold had left her in no mood to expose herself to
chilling night air. As several days elapsed,
Madge&rsquo;s own interest in the mansion waned.</p>
<p>And then on Saturday morning as she was walking
to the store for a pound of sugar which Mrs.
Brady had forgotten to order, she was startled to
observe that the front gate of the Swenster Mansion
stood ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That padlock didn&rsquo;t come off by itself,&rdquo; she
thought alertly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>The temptation to investigate was too great to
resist. She paused at the gate and looked inside
the grounds. To her further amazement, she saw
the front door open and a workman was removing
boards from the downstairs windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; said a pleasant voice.</p>
<p>Madge jumped. Turning, she saw a middle-aged,
white-haired lady, standing by a mock
orange bush slightly to the left of the gate. She
was regarding Madge with a kindly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; the latter apologized
in embarrassment. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone was at
home. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at your interest in the place,&rdquo;
the lady came quickly to her rescue. &ldquo;The house
has been closed for so many years that it must be
a town curiosity. Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think not,&rdquo; Madge murmured, yet aching
to do that very thing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to intrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be no intrusion I assure you,&rdquo; the other
responded warmly. &ldquo;I was wishing only a moment
ago that someone would drop in to visit me. I
suppose all my old friends are gone by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed, and Madge saw an expression akin
to sorrow cross her face. Immediately she smiled
again and opened the gate wider.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do come in. The house and grounds are in
frightful condition but within a few days I hope to
have them in better shape. Perhaps you will help
me with suggestions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge could not resist such an appeal. Actually,
she desired nothing more than an opportunity to
talk with the woman, perhaps learning what had
brought her to Claymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to come in,&rdquo; she smiled, passing
through the gate, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not very good at suggestions
about gardening. You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re the
owner, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Agatha Swenster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge introduced herself. Miss Swenster knew
how to place her at ease, and soon she lost all feeling
of embarrassment. They wandered slowly
about the ruined garden. Mrs. Swenster pointed
out various things which she planned to have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must seem nice to be coming back to your
old home,&rdquo; Madge commented politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a way it does. A great many memories
are associated with this house&mdash;some very pleasant,
others less so. Now that I am here again I
should like to remain. However, I fear it is impossible.
I am merely putting the place in order
before I sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge&rsquo;s face disclosed her disappointment.
She could not imagine the old mansion in the hands
of a ruthless, modern owner who might tear down
the shutters, do away with the old-fashioned
garden and relandscape the grounds. It was definitely
a house of the past, and Miss Swenster fitted
perfectly into the picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not anxious to sell,&rdquo; the owner confessed,
&ldquo;but I have no choice. I plan to hold an auction
sale in a few weeks. The house is furnished with
really lovely pieces of furniture. I should like
to have you see my dishes sometime before the
sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame to auction off such valued possessions,&rdquo;
Madge said with honest regret. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
you holding anything back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little. You see, I must raise money and
this house is all I have left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently realizing that she had paraded her
personal affairs, Miss Swenster quickly changed
the subject. They continued their tour of the
garden, pausing near the sundial. Madge ventured
to ask if it had been manufactured special
for the Swenster Mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we made it ourselves,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Father worked out the plans before his death, and
an old Negro servant did the actual work later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved hurriedly on, as though not wishing
to dwell upon a subject which brought back unhappy
associations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>It had occurred to Madge to speak of the recent
excavations which had been going on in the garden
but after a moment&rsquo;s consideration she decided to
allow the matter to go unmentioned.</p>
<p>She was eager to learn if the man Miss Swenster
had engaged to assist with the outside work was
the same person she and Cara had observed during
their prior visit to the mansion. As Miss Swenster
paused to issue orders in regard to trimming the
hedge, she had ample opportunity to study the
workman&rsquo;s face. She was certain he was not the
man she had seen digging in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plot thickens,&rdquo; she thought with quickening
interest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager Miss Swenster doesn&rsquo;t
know any more about that digging than I do. Perhaps
if I get a little better acquainted, I&rsquo;ll ask her
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge readily accepted an invitation to view
the inside of the house. Nothing was in order
and dust was everywhere. Miss Swenster lifted
several white sheets to disclose that they protected
really fine mahogany and oak pieces. She did not
offer to show Madge the upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I have my work cut out for me,&rdquo; she
smiled. &ldquo;I must go over everything, sort out the
pieces I mean to keep, and get things generally
in order before the auction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you need a woman to help you, I know of
an excellent one,&rdquo; Madge offered. &ldquo;She did work
for Aunt Maude.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>She noticed Miss Swenster&rsquo;s embarrassed face
and realized that she had been tactless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hire help but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t afford
it,&rdquo; Miss Swenster said quietly. &ldquo;I am quite
strong and will be able to manage alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge thought Miss Swenster looked frail and
scarcely able to do heavy housework. She was
tempted to offer her own services gratis but realized
that unless she were very diplomatic, Miss
Swenster would be certain to refuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find some way to help her with the work,&rdquo;
she told herself as she departed a few minutes later.
&ldquo;I know Cara will be glad to do what she can too.
And if we should happen to learn something pertaining
to the lost Swenster pearls&mdash;well, there&rsquo;s
no harm in killing two birds with one stone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br /><i>The Inside Story</i></h2>
<p>In the end Madge decided that the easiest way
to help Miss Swenster would be to disregard propriety
and descend boldly upon her. Accordingly,
the next morning, which was a school holiday, she
and Cara Wayne dressed in their old clothes and
armed with brooms and dust cloths, presented
themselves at the back door of the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to help,&rdquo; they announced blithely.
&ldquo;Please say we may, for we want an excuse to see
your dishes and the lovely heirlooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were not certain how this blunt approach
would be received, but after the first look of astonishment,
Miss Swenster smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how very thoughtful of you both. I&rsquo;ll
be delighted to have you help. Goodness knows
there is enough to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed her inside. Miss Swenster had
straightened the living room but had made no
attempt to put other rooms to rights. The girls
attacked the work with vigor. It progressed
slowly for there was a great deal to be done and
they frequently stopped to examine some object
which struck their fancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame this house has to be sold,&rdquo; Cara
declared to her chum. &ldquo;Miss Swenster doesn&rsquo;t say
much about it but you can tell it makes her fairly
sick to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Madge agreed in an undertone. &ldquo;I
wish we could really do something for her, but
I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible for the girls to work side by
side with Miss Swenster and not learn more of her
fine character and interesting history. Soon they
caught themselves telling her about Skull and
Crossbones and Cara&rsquo;s weird experience in connection
with the midnight initiation. Miss Swenster
expressed an interest in the secret society and
did not appear in the least annoyed because they
had trespassed. Nor did she seem disturbed to
learn of the stranger who prowled about the
garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea who it could have been,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;Perhaps it was only a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was much too well dressed for that,&rdquo; Madge
returned. &ldquo;We thought possibly he might be digging
for some treasure that had been hidden on
the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster studied the girls quizzically.
Her eyes twinkled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I only wish there were a lost treasure!
I am afraid you girls have been listening to
wild stories. The Swensters were never as
wealthy as townfolks thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t true about the pearl necklace?&rdquo;
Cara asked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I never saw the pearls myself,
but according to the family legend, they did exist.
I suppose you know the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls shook their heads, waiting eagerly. At
last they were to hear the true account of what
became of the famous pearls!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I believe this myself,&rdquo; Miss
Swenster warned, &ldquo;but at least the story was
handed down to me. As you may know, the pearls
were willed to my mother, Rose Swenster. That
was her maiden name, of course. She married
young and was divorced soon after my birth. She
took back her maiden name and I always used it
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to return to the pearls. My mother never
had them. Her sister, Florence, felt that she had
been cheated in the will. She was so beside herself
that she actually hid the pearls, saying that if she
could not have them, they should never be worn by
my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How mean!&rdquo; Cara exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the story isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; Miss Swenster
smiled. &ldquo;My mother never mentioned the pearls
to me. I learned the tale from the nursemaid who
cared for me after Mother&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Florence never told where she hid the
pearls?&rdquo; Madge probed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a short time later she fell ill. When she
realized she could not get well, she tried to tell
what she had done with the pearls, but failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one had the slightest hint what became of
them?&rdquo; Cara questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the story, I believe an old Negro
caretaker was supposed to know something about
it. His name was George Andrew Jackson. He
must have been seventy at the time Florence died.
At any rate he was very forgetful and either
would not or could not tell what became of the
pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was a search never made?&rdquo; Madge inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, yes. Every inch of the house was
gone over and the grounds were carefully searched.
As a child, I used to think perhaps I could restore
the Swenster fortunes. &lsquo;Hunt the pearls&rsquo; was our
favorite game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>It struck Madge and Cara that their interest in
the lost necklace was not very original. They
harbored secret hopes of locating the pearls and
had even been guilty of trying to connect Miss
Swenster&rsquo;s loss with the mysterious excavations
of the midnight prowler. They were unwilling to
believe that the story was pure legend. And the
fact that two generations of Swensters had failed
to recover the pearls, could not entirely daunt them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten the matter until you girls reminded
me of it,&rdquo; Miss Swenster remarked.
&ldquo;Years ago, when my John was a little boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off, coloring. Then, apparently
thinking that some explanation was expected, she
finished lamely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John was my adopted son. As a boy, he was
interested in the pearls too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time she had mentioned the name
of her son. The girls realized that Miss Swenster
had not intended to speak of him. The words had
slipped out unbidden. Even to think of him seemed
to distress her, for she quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>The girls remained for luncheon, helping Miss
Swenster prepare it. They worked through to
four o&rsquo;clock and as they left for their homes, asked
if they might come again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she assured them, &ldquo;although I
can&rsquo;t see what fun you get out of working. If I
could pay you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls hastily explained that they did not
want pay. They really had enjoyed the day for it
was fun to browse about the old mansion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mind if we look around for those
pearls?&rdquo; Madge inquired. &ldquo;In sorting out things
we might stumble upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster smiled at her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search anywhere you wish, but don&rsquo;t be too
disappointed if you fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had a great deal to talk over as they
walked slowly toward their homes. They were
very tired but the day had been a highly satisfactory
one. The prospect of roaming over the old
mansion at will was very alluring. Already Madge
had several places in mind where she thought
possibly they might find the missing pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fine it would be if we could find the necklace
before the mansion is sold,&rdquo; Cara mused.
&ldquo;Then Miss Swenster could go on living there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she wouldn&rsquo;t care to. When she left
here eight years ago, she must have had a reason
other than financial for closing up the house. I
suppose it was on account of her adopted son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you imagine he did that turned her
against him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea. He must have done something
disgraceful. I&rsquo;d like to know what it was, but of
course, we must never ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had every intention of returning to the
old mansion the next night after school. In planning
their search for the missing pearls, they did
not overlook the garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel there&rsquo;s something valuable buried near
the fountain, or the sundial,&rdquo; Madge declared.
&ldquo;It may not be the pearls but at least it&rsquo;s worth
investigating. So tomorrow bring your father&rsquo;s
spade and we&rsquo;ll do a little digging of our own!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br /><i>A Face Dishonored</i></h2>
<p>It was only natural that Madge and Cara, sharing
their delightful secret, should seek each other&rsquo;s
company, somewhat to the exclusion of other
friends. They did not mean to be aloof, but always
there were many private matters which they wished
to discuss. In school they passed a great many
notes and one of these, which read: &ldquo;Did you get
the spade?&rdquo; was accidentally intercepted by Enid
Burnett who thought it intended for her. The
message caused her considerable wonderment. At
recess she managed to corner Madge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you two up to?&rdquo; she demanded
suspiciously. &ldquo;Have you gone in for
gardening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, in a way,&rdquo; Madge evaded.</p>
<p>Until they had a real story to relate, she and
Cara preferred to keep the other members of Skull
and Crossbones in the dark concerning their activities.
To tell their friends immediately might
subject them to an unmerciful teasing. Nevertheless,
Enid and Jane were not to be hoodwinked so
easily. They guessed that they were being excluded
from some secret, and as school was dismissed,
stationed themselves at the front door
ready to waylay their friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Madge and Cara had been anticipating such a
move, and quietly slipped out the back way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret isn&rsquo;t a secret if too many are in on it,&rdquo;
Madge defended their action. &ldquo;We can tell them
later on, but for a few days let&rsquo;s keep it to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara had hidden the spade in the high weeds of
a vacant lot not far from the Swenster mansion.
They rescued it and proceeded to their destination,
not at all disturbed by the curious stares focused
upon them by persons they met on the street.</p>
<p>After securing permission from Miss Swenster,
they went immediately to the garden. They took
turns digging, investigating all the filled holes near
the fountain and sundial. Finding nothing, they
carefully replaced all soil turned up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t make me think that man was
digging just for the exercise,&rdquo; Madge fretted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he found what he was after,&rdquo; Cara
suggested pessimistically. &ldquo;In that case we&rsquo;re only
wasting our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster presently came out to watch the
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such ambition!&rdquo; she marveled. &ldquo;When you
have finished, I want you to come inside and have
some of the chocolate cake I baked this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another fifteen minutes had elapsed, the
girls decided they were doing entirely too much
damage to the garden, and abandoned their
project for the day. After such backbreaking
work it was pleasant to sit in the comfortable living
room, sipping hot chocolate and nibbling at
Miss Swenster&rsquo;s delicious cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly all the work is done now except that I
must pack small articles in boxes,&rdquo; their hostess
told them. &ldquo;The dishes must be sorted too.&rdquo; She
sighed. &ldquo;It hurts to see everything go but I do
hope the auction will be well attended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge and Cara eagerly offered to help with the
packing, and after a polite protest, Miss Swenster
agreed that they might. It was too late to work
that afternoon but they promised to appear early
Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The two intervening days passed slowly. At
nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the third, the girls
presented themselves again at the mansion. They
found Miss Swenster sorting out old photographs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very trying to decide which ones I must
throw away,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to save them
all but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The girls expressed interest in the photographs
and Miss Swenster showed them the picture of
her mother, and of Florence Swenster. In looking
at the youthful, sweet faces of the two sisters, it
was difficult for Madge and Cara to realize that
they could ever have been jealous rivals. They
rapidly ran through the other photos, laughing at
ridiculous poses or dresses that were amazingly old
fashioned.</p>
<p>After they had finished looking at pictures, they
set to work packing dishes. It gave them a genuine
thrill to handle the choice pieces of porcelain and
china.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything to the study yet,&rdquo; Miss
Swenster told them a little later. &ldquo;I must get at
that room as soon as we finish the dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently she went upstairs on an errand. Before
she returned, the girls packed the last dish.
The study door was open and after waiting a few
minutes they decided to see what must be done
there.</p>
<p>They saw that the walls were lined with books
which required packing. Coverings had not been
removed from the furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>Cara turned to see her chum regarding an object
above the old secretary. It was a picture, and most
strangely, its face was turned toward the wall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo; Madge whispered.
&ldquo;The other pictures aren&rsquo;t this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the temptation was too great. Cara
turned the picture over. A handsome young boy
with round, full cheeks, twinkling eyes and a
cropped head of golden curly hair, gazed down
from the frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; Cara murmured.</p>
<p>Before Madge could reply, they heard footsteps
on the stairway. A moment later, Miss Swenster
entered the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All through with the dishes?&rdquo; she asked cheerfully.
&ldquo;My, but you are fast&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice trailed
off and her entire body seemed to stiffen. She had
noticed the picture on the wall.</p>
<p>She murmured something which the girls did not
catch. Crossing the room, she removed the picture
from its hook, and carried it from the study.
The girls heard her mounting the stairs.</p>
<p>For a moment they were too dumbfounded to
speak. Then Madge exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we get for our ill bred curiosity!
We&rsquo;ve offended her terribly. It must have been
her son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara nodded miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing we can do is to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>They spent an unhappy fifteen minutes waiting
for Miss Swenster to return. Madge was on the
verge of suggesting that it might be better for
them to leave, when she appeared. She smiled
brightly as if nothing had happened, but they could
see she had been crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re terribly sorry,&rdquo; Madge began contritely.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to be prying. It was simply inexcusable
of us to touch the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. It was nothing you did that
affected me. Please, if you don&rsquo;t mind, let&rsquo;s not
mention it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster was especially nice to the girls
after that but the incident could not be forgotten
in an instant. She made no further mention of
cleaning the study and Madge and Cara carefully
avoided the subject. They could tell that Miss
Swenster was still upset. A half hour later they
made an excuse for leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come again,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve been
very inhospitable. If you don&rsquo;t come back I&rsquo;ll feel
that I&rsquo;ve driven you away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were rather silent as they walked
thoughtfully along the street. It was as if a measure
of Miss Swenster&rsquo;s unhappiness had fallen
upon their shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so sorry for her,&rdquo; Madge said after a
time. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s made an idol of that boy. And he&rsquo;s
brought her nothing but unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara glanced quickly at her friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that for sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I intended to tell you the first thing today,
but it slipped my mind. I found out through Uncle
George what her son had done to disgrace the
family. And when you hear the story, you&rsquo;ll not
blame Miss Swenster for turning his face to the
wall!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br /><i>The Mahogany Desk</i></h2>
<p>The girls had reached the Wayne home. It was
nearly supper time but Cara would not allow
Madge to escape without relating all there was to
know concerning Miss Swenster&rsquo;s adopted son.
They sat down on the front steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I asked Uncle George if he knew
why John Swenster left town,&rdquo; Madge explained.
&ldquo;Of course, it was a wild shot in the dark, for I
never dreamed he could tell me. Well, it seems
he was one of the few persons in Claymore who
really knew the inside story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck! Tell me what he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that the boy never did amount to a
great deal. He must have had bad heredity. Anyway,
Miss Swenster took him from an orphan&rsquo;s
home. She gave him every advantage, sending
him away to school and later trying to establish him
in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably where a lot of her money
went,&rdquo; Cara observed sagely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she wasted plenty on him. He never appreciated
it. He was always getting into one
scrape or another. Then one day he up and forged
a check for over a thousand dollars! Uncle George
was a director in the First National bank where the
matter came up. That&rsquo;s how he happened to know
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara looked aghast at the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did they send him to prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Swenster offered to pay the amount
of the forged check, and the person whose name
had been used, agreed not to prosecute. Her son
left town and soon after that Miss Swenster closed
up the old mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it broke her heart to have him turn
out so badly,&rdquo; Cara mused. &ldquo;And when she was
having financial troubles of her own it must have
been hard for her to raise the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was unfortunate all around,&rdquo; Madge
agreed, getting up from the steps. &ldquo;I must dash
home now or I&rsquo;ll be late for supper. See you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls did not go to the Swenster mansion the
following day or the next. Their evenings were
spent cramming for month-end examinations
which always were a trial, even to Madge who
stood high in her classes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Then one day, the girls noticed a brief advertisement
in the daily paper, announcing that on the
tenth of October, the Swenster mansion and all its
furniture would be sold at public auction. It reminded
them that if they intended to make another
search for the missing pearls, they must be about it.</p>
<p>Saturday morning found them on their way to
the mansion. It was a crisp, fall day, the first
really cold one of the season. Madge&rsquo;s eyes were
very bright and she was so gay that she fairly
skipped along the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; Cara demanded. Then as
she noticed a white envelope protruding from her
friend&rsquo;s sweater pocket: &ldquo;Ha! I&rsquo;ll bet a cent it&rsquo;s
from that ranger of yours up at Loon Lake! He
writes you twice a week, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not!&rdquo; Madge denied, blushing furiously.
&ldquo;Jack has more important things to do than
write letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t pretend, Madge Sterling. You
know you like him. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll not even look
at any of the boys here in Claymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I like Jack. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? He&rsquo;s
a good friend and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked somewhat nettled as Cara burst forth
in a gale of exaggerated laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, laugh! But unless I&rsquo;m most horribly
mistaken I saw you in Rexall&rsquo;s Drug Store last
night lapping up a soda and listening moon-eyed
while Fred King gave a running report of last
week&rsquo;s football game. You&mdash;who can&rsquo;t be dragged
near the stadium!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only try to be a polite listener,&rdquo; Cara said
cheerfully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call it quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smiled, and linking arms, hurried on to
the mansion. Miss Swenster was delighted to see
them again for she had begun to fear that she
had offended them during their last visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came,&rdquo; she greeted them.
&ldquo;After today, everything will be turned topsy-turvy
since the furniture must be arranged for the
sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster spoke cheerfully of the approaching
auction, but the girls realized that she was hiding
her real feelings. In little ways, more by look
and gesture than by words, she had disclosed that
she disliked to see her old home sold.</p>
<p>There really was no immediate work to be done
save dusting, which Miss Swenster declared
unnecessary. However, the girls armed themselves
with dust cloths and roamed about over the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do more looking than dusting,&rdquo; Madge
assured Miss Swenster. &ldquo;This may be our last
chance to search for the pearls. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be
grand if we found them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be marvelous! But I really have no
faith that you&rsquo;ll locate them. As I said before, I
fear you&rsquo;re searching for something that never
existed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one place we haven&rsquo;t looked,&rdquo; Madge
said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the attic. May we go up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I was cleaning out some of the
rubbish today, but the old furniture is still there.
The pieces are really worthless and I doubt if I&rsquo;ll
even put them up at the sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were moving up the stairway, when
Miss Swenster called them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one thing more. Your prowler has returned.
Last night I heard a noise in the garden.
I went to the window just in time to see a man
hurrying out the back gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo; Cara asked.</p>
<p>Miss Swenster shook her head. &ldquo;No, only
curious. I can&rsquo;t imagine what he can be after.
If I see him again, I shall call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After asking a few questions, the girls went
on upstairs to the attic. It was a large, roomy
affair with only one small window high above their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ug!&rdquo; Cara emitted as she brushed against a
cobweb. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She became more enthusiastic as she noted an
interesting array of boxes, old chests, and discarded
furniture. It was fun to dig into things.
Madge discovered a Paisley shawl which she insisted
was a treasure and Cara found a beautiful
woven coverlet stored away with old clothing. But
there was not so much as a clue to the whereabouts
of the Swenster pearls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>At last, grimy and tired, the girls returned to
the living room, bearing their plunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had even forgotten I owned such things,&rdquo;
Miss Swenster declared when they showed her
the shawl and the coverlet. &ldquo;My grandmother
wove that spread herself. And the shawl was
brought over to this country so many years back
that I&rsquo;ve forgotten the exact date. Dear me, how
I shall hate to dispose of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; Madge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t very well keep them. I have saved out
so many treasures now that I&rsquo;ll not have places to
store them. I know! You girls must accept them
as gifts! I&rsquo;ll give Madge the shawl and Cara the
coverlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster refused to listen to their protests.
In the end they thanked her profusely for
the generous gifts, promising they would take good
care of them. Both were proud to own such
treasures. They were eager to return home to
display their prizes, but first they insisted upon
doing the dusting which they had started hours
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Miss Swenster again assured them it was unnecessary.
Nevertheless, they went about it in
business-like fashion, working vigorously. Soon
only the study remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we dust in there?&rdquo; Madge inquired, not
wishing to repeat the mistake previously made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if you like,&rdquo; Miss Swenster returned
with only the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>Entering the study, the girls looked with one
accord toward the place where John Swenster&rsquo;s
picture had hung. A bright square of wallpaper
marked the former spot. Miss Swenster had not
replaced the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she did with it?&rdquo; Cara whispered.</p>
<p>Madge shook her head, raising a finger to her
lips in mute warning that Miss Swenster could
easily hear from the next room.</p>
<p>They silently went about the dusting, bent upon
getting it done as quickly as possible. Cara directed
her attention to the bookcases while Madge made
an attack upon the paneled mahogany desk. She
dusted the top and polished off the curved legs.
Then her cloth swept across one of the panels.</p>
<p>Madge heard a sharp click. To her amazement,
the panel dropped down, revealing a small
opening!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br /><i>The Secret Compartment</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, blow me down!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed, relapsing
into comic-strip slang as she always did
when greatly excited. &ldquo;A spring panel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara had rushed to her side and was staring
wide-eyed at the secret compartment revealed in
the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something inside!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh,
I hope it&rsquo;s the pearls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge thrust her hand into the dark opening.
Her face brightened as she felt something not
unlike a leather jewel case. She brought it to light,
holding it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Cara exclaimed in disappointment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
nothing but an old book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A diary,&rdquo; Madge corrected. &ldquo;Well, I guess it
was too much to expect that we&rsquo;d find the pearls.
I suppose Miss Swenster knows about this compartment
but let&rsquo;s ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stepped to the door and called. Miss
Swenster answered from the kitchen, and later
entered the study, wiping her hands on her apron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look what we found in the desk,&rdquo; Madge said,
handing her the diary. &ldquo;I must have touched a
hidden spring when I was dusting. The panel fell
down to reveal this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster moved quickly to the desk, her
face showing that the information astonished her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed there was a secret compartment,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;This desk belonged to Florence
Swenster, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the diary may have been hers too,&rdquo; Madge
observed.</p>
<p>Miss Swenster opened the little book and quickly
ran through the yellowed pages. The writing was
cramped and difficult to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Florence&rsquo;s diary, I am sure of it.
I have seen her writing on a number of old letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why she hid her diary in such a
strange place?&rdquo; Cara mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I imagine it was just a girl&rsquo;s desire for
privacy,&rdquo; Miss Swenster returned. &ldquo;Florence
was a queer one in a good many ways though.
I&rsquo;m sure she never told anyone about this secret
compartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent to examine it again. She closed the
panel, hearing it click as it went firmly into place.
But try as she would, she could not open it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; Madge offered. &ldquo;I know about
where my hand was when it touched the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Miss Swenster stepped aside and Madge moved
her hand over the panel exploring its surface.
At first she had no better success, then her fingers
pressed the spring in just the right manner and the
panel popped open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a sideways pressure,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Cara and Miss Swenster both experimented until
they had learned the secret. In the meantime,
Madge had picked up the diary and was studying it
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;could Florence have written anything
in here about the pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster regarded Madge with frank admiration
and approval. At first she had thought
the search for the pearls only a useless, amusing
whim of the girls. Now she recognized that a
sound idea lay behind Madge&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not read the diary?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If
Florence had any secrets to hide, it&rsquo;s time they were
aired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion suited the girls admirably. Immediately
forgetting their intention to return
home early, they dropped down on the black plush
settee and were soon lost to the world. Miss
Swenster went quietly back to the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>It was almost impossible at first to make out
the cramped, fine writing. The girls laboriously
studied out several paragraphs which were disappointingly
trite. Florence had recorded in detail
her trips to the dressmakers, visits with
relatives and parties attended.</p>
<p>Madge and Cara were becoming discouraged
when they happened upon the first notation concerning
the necklace. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I attracted unusual attention tonight when I
wore the pearls to the Alstone&rsquo;s ball. How Rose
envied me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara gave a little squeal of delight and hugged
her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our proof that the pearls really did
exist. The necklace wasn&rsquo;t a myth as so many
folks thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she tells what became of it. Read on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For another half hour they delved into the diary,
finding little of interest to reward their patience.
Then they turned a page and read a brief item
disclosing that Florence&rsquo;s jealousy of her sister
was growing more bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose is very sly,&rdquo; she had written. &ldquo;She is
ingratiating herself with father, hoping that he
will will her the pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have had a distorted view of things,&rdquo;
Cara observed. &ldquo;From all that we&rsquo;ve heard, Rose
wasn&rsquo;t a bit designing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge had turned on ahead in the diary; She
gazed at her chum with startled eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s almost the last notation. See all
these blank pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just when it became interesting,&rdquo; Cara wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite through. There are a few
more paragraphs scattered through the diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swiftly turned the pages. Cara leaned
closer as they came to one brief sentence. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father died today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full minute, the girls stared at the notation,
trying to make more of it. Then Cara burst
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d have written more
about a thing like that? Not a word of his sickness
or anything. While she&rsquo;d fill page after page with
drivel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she was too moved about his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Cara acknowledged doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
quicker think she was worrying about the pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they could read on, Miss Swenster came
into the study to say that luncheon was ready.
The girls sprang guiltily to their feet, declaring
that they could not stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; their hostess assured them, smiling.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already telephoned to your homes. And
everything is on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Miss Swenster was an excellent cook, and
Madge and Cara who had healthy, growing appetites,
did justice to her fine luncheon. However,
they were so excited over the diary that had they
eaten bread and milk, they would not have noticed.
All during the meal they chattered gaily, telling
Miss Swenster everything they had discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We scarcely can wait until we read the rest,&rdquo;
Cara laughed. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just sure Florence will
tell what she did with the pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster had tried hard not to allow the
enthusiasm of her young friends to carry her
away, but her cheeks were flushed and her eyes
brighter than the girls had even seen them. She
fairly beamed as she urged them to second helpings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not count on the pearls until I see them,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But, oh! What wouldn&rsquo;t I do if they
should turn up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara and Madge glanced at her with curious
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what would you do?&rdquo; Madge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I&rsquo;d reward you girls for finding them!
Then I&rsquo;d call off that sale. I&rsquo;d get a gardener again
and have this place restored to its former condition.
Oh, I would do so many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the tone of Miss Swenster&rsquo;s voice that told
Madge and Cara exactly how deep was her feeling
for the old mansion. She had arranged her
sale with business-like indifference to sentiment,
but underneath, it hurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Madge made a silent resolution that she would
never give up until the pearls were found. Surely,
the old diary would furnish the clue she needed!</p>
<p>The girls helped with the dishes. The instant
they had stacked them away, they hurried back to
the study, burying themselves again in the diary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re nearly at the end,&rdquo; Madge warned.
&ldquo;Hold your breath and hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned several blank pages, and then in
an awed voice read aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was unfair of my father to will the pearls
to Rose, though the action did not surprise me
greatly. I am determined she never shall wear
them! If I cannot have them myself, then I shall
hide them where they never will be found.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Cara breathed. &ldquo;How mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Madge commanded, reading on: &ldquo;&lsquo;I
have taken only old Uncle George into my confidence
and he has sworn that he will never tell.
Last night, when everyone was abed we hid the
pearls in the&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of the page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her eagerness, Madge fumbled the sheets.
At last she managed to get the page turned over,
but as she stared down, she uttered a startled gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s missing! The page that told about the
pearls has been torn out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br /><i>The Torn Page</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t the last straw!&rdquo; Cara exclaimed
indignantly. She permitted herself one glance at
the place where the page had been torn from the
diary and sank limply back against the settee.
&ldquo;After keying myself up to hear the grand solution,
the whole thing falls flat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like wilted spinach myself,&rdquo; Madge admitted.
She closed the diary with an impatient
snap, placing it on the table. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re at the
end. The page that was torn out, was the last
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be,&rdquo; Cara groaned. &ldquo;Our chance of
helping Miss Swenster has gone glimmering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you guess became of the missing
page?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Florence tore it out herself and
burned it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge agreed that the theory was a likely one.
However, she suggested that some other person
might have taken the page. The thought left her
even more depressed, for in that case, it was likely
that whoever had learned the hiding place, had long
ago taken the pearls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The girls were so thoroughly disheartened that it
was some time before they summoned courage to
report their failure to Miss Swenster. Her face
fell at the news but she tried not to show how keen
was her disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, I owe you both a great deal for
your interest in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving the mansion, Madge asked permission
to take the diary home for a few days. In
their haste to reach the end, the girls had not read
every paragraph but had skipped those that looked
uninteresting. Madge had little hope that she
would find any new material, but at least thought
it would do no harm to reread the diary at her
leisure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never admit defeat, do you?&rdquo; Cara asked
as they walked home together. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m
concerned, I consider the adventure washed-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t completely given up,&rdquo; Madge returned.
&ldquo;But I must confess I haven&rsquo;t a tangible
clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not have time to reread the diary that
night, and in truth, she rather dreaded the ordeal.
It was a long tedious task, one that offered slight
hope of success. Nevertheless, Madge continued
to think of the Swenster pearls and to wonder if
she had not overlooked some hitherto unimportant
clue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the diary Florence said that she had taken
old Uncle George Jackson into her confidence.
Why didn&rsquo;t I think to ask Miss Swenster who she
meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed such an oversight that Sunday
afternoon she dropped around at the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle George?&rdquo; Miss Swenster repeated, in
response to her question. &ldquo;Why, he was the old
Negro caretaker I told you about. You can&rsquo;t hope
to learn anything from him for he has been dead
years and years. In fact, his son is an old man
now. Or was the last time I heard. He too may be
dead by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge came to life at this scrap of information.
Instantly it flashed through her mind that possibly
Uncle George Jackson&rsquo;s son might know something
of the pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me his name?&rdquo; she questioned
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle George&rsquo;s son? Why, it must have been
Ross. Yes, that was it. Ross Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster knew very little concerning either
the old caretaker or his son. When she had left
Claymore eight years before, Ross Jackson had
been living in a shack down by the railroad tracks
but she did not know what had become of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should have looked after him,&rdquo; she said regretfully.
&ldquo;I always intended to, but I have had
very little ready money. Now that he is an old man
it must be difficult for him to find work. I wish
I could afford to employ him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge went away with the avowed intention
of discovering what had become of old Uncle Ross
Jackson. His name was not in the telephone or
city directories. She inquired of any number of
persons without success.</p>
<p>Then Jane Allen came to the rescue. Among
others, Madge had asked her if she had ever heard
of the old Negro. At the time, Jane could not help
her, but she had inquired of their negress wash
woman and had learned the location of Uncle Ross&rsquo;
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to the information, but I&rsquo;d
not advise you to be going down there by the tracks
alone,&rdquo; Jane warned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what&rsquo;s
gotten into you lately. You&rsquo;re so quiet and
secretive. Always wanting to know such odd
things too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not enlighten her as to what had
caused the change, though she was tempted to disclose
everything. She knew that Jane and Enid
both were somewhat hurt because they felt they
were being excluded from something. She must
make it up to them later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Madge had no intention of venturing alone down
into the slum district of Claymore. She broached
the subject of the trip with Cara who was willing
to accompany her when she comprehended that the
visit might have an important bearing on the missing
pearls.</p>
<p>Monday night after school, Madge borrowed
her uncle&rsquo;s car and they set forth upon their quest.
The house they sought was set well back from the
road. They parked the car and walked toward a
dilapidated shack with a caved-in roof. The place
seemed deserted save for a Plymouth Rock hen
which fussed busily over her downy brood and a
lank, hungry-looking hound that lay on the door-step
with eyes half closed as if he were dreaming of
some exciting coon hunt of a long departed day
when both he and his master were younger.</p>
<p>Cara was afraid of the hound and though he
scarcely looked in her direction, held timidly back.
Madge went boldly to the door and knocked. There
were stirrings within and presently Uncle Ross
came to the door, knuckling his eyes as if he had
been aroused from a nap, which indeed he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Miss, howdy,&rdquo; he said to Madge and
smiled at Cara. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you step right in&mdash;dat is,
if you can find a groove to walk in with all this
dishevelment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>The girls returned the greeting, suggesting that
they all sit under a tree in the front yard where
Uncle Ross had provided a bench for smoking and
resting purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; Madge began when they were seated,
&ldquo;I have been told that your father was a caretaker
at the old Swenster place years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed he was, chile. He&rsquo;s tole me dat many a
time. &rsquo;Sides dat, I used to live dere myself when I
was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that your father ever mentioned
anything about the family pearls?&rdquo; Madge
inquired, watching him closely. &ldquo;I mean the ones
that were lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dem pearls! I used to hear heaps about
&rsquo;em but dey just faded out wid de years. Sometimes
I thinks dey neveh was any pearls&mdash;just
ghost pearls dat went up in smoke if dey eveh was
any such-like jewels in de family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you recall anything your father ever
said about where he thought they had been hidden?&rdquo;
Madge persisted.</p>
<p>Uncle Ross scratched his white wool, assuming
a pose of deep reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah ole memory is full o&rsquo; holes now, Miss. It
was so long ago dat de ole haid has lost its grip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But try and think, Uncle! What were your
father&rsquo;s duties about the place. He was a gardener
for one thing, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. De ole man was one of de expertest
gardeners in dis town. Dey wasn&rsquo;t anotheh family
in dis whole town dat had a garden like dem Swenster
folks&mdash;roses a ramblin&rsquo; around over de walls
and honeysuckles loaded down wid hummin&rsquo; birds.
Dey don&rsquo;t have no more quality white folks dese
days, no suh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Uncle,&rdquo; Madge insisted, smiling at the implication
of her own social status. &ldquo;Surely you
remember something your father said about the
pearls. Maybe just a few words or even one
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Ross reflected deeply again and then replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I does remembeh dat de ole man was powerful
wurrit &rsquo;bout what happened to dem pearls. Fust
place, he was &rsquo;fraid folks would say <i>he</i> stole &rsquo;em
and he was de honestest culled man in dis town.
Yes, suh! Why, de ole man was a Deacon in de
church and de ministeh used to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge saw he was going off on a new tangent
so tried to draw him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Uncle. No one ever thought your
father took the pearls. All we want to know is if
you recall anything he ever said about where he
thought they might have been hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Negro reflected deeply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss, I does remembeh dat when de ole
man was in dis here very same house a passin&rsquo; on
to de otheh shore and sort of talkin&rsquo; wild-like jest
before he died, he said somethin&rsquo; about de pearls.
And den he said another word. Let me think.
What was it he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girls waited patiently, hoping that he
would be able to furnish the clue they needed,
Uncle Ross seemed to lose control of his briefly
gathered memories. Madge could almost see them
slipping away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think hard, Uncle,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;What was
the word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Ross made one last grand effort to remember.
He closed his eyes, shaking his head in a
baffled sort of way.</p>
<p>Then speaking very slowly, as though probing
his memory almost beyond its powers, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Miss, he said somethin&rsquo; about de
sun. No, dat wasn&rsquo;t it neither. It was sun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>sundial</i>,&rdquo; Madge supplied eagerly.</p>
<p>Uncle Ross&rsquo; dark face brightened and he
slapped his thigh a resounding whack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat was it! De word de ole man said was
sundial!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br /><i>Uncle Ross&rsquo; Hint</i></h2>
<p>Cara and Madge questioned Uncle Ross further,
trying ineffectually to bring out additional information.
The old Negro had scraped his memory
bare and could recall nothing more concerning the
pearls. The girls presently thanked him and in
turning to leave, Madge handed him a dollar bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss, thank you,&rdquo; he beamed and
bowed.</p>
<p>The girls walked back to the parked car, only
moderately pleased at the outcome of the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there really is a connection between
the pearls and the sundial?&rdquo; Cara asked
somewhat skeptically as they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I do,&rdquo; Madge returned. &ldquo;Unless Uncle
Ross&rsquo; memory played him false. It&rsquo;s a pretty vague
hint, but perhaps we can make something of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can,&rdquo; Cara corrected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no
good at puzzles and this one takes the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Madge soon reached the edge of darktown, taking
a main street which led to the better section of
Claymore. She drove like an expert automaton, her
eyes glued on the road but her thoughts many
miles away. She came to life with a start as the car
wheels struck a hole in the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cara, I was just thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t or we may end up in a ditch,&rdquo;
Cara laughed. &ldquo;What were you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge scarcely knew how to tell what was
in her mind. It seemed reasonable to her that
the Swenster pearls might have been hidden in the
garden near the sundial. In digging about, the
girls had not paid particular attention to the old
sundial, but had confined themselves to the general
locality disturbed by the prowler. Madge
was convinced too that the man they had seen
was after the same thing&mdash;the Swenster pearls.
How he had learned of them she could not imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we did do some of our digging near
the sundial,&rdquo; she said to Cara, &ldquo;but at the time
we never dreamed there was any connection. Now
my idea is to go back there and look over the situation
again. It may be that at a certain hour the
gnomon casts a shadow at the designated place.
I&rsquo;ve read of such things in story books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t a story book,&rdquo; Cara protested in
a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my personal opinion
that the pearls are gone. If they were ever hidden
in the garden, that prowler has them by this time!
Otherwise, why hasn&rsquo;t he been back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s been afraid. And he did return
one night, for Miss Swenster heard him. I wish
we could catch him at it and turn him over to the
police for questioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Cara was reluctant to resume excavation
activities, she agreed to make one more attempt
when Madge promised to do most of the digging.
It was too late to go to the Swenster mansion that
evening but the following afternoon they went
there directly after school.</p>
<p>They set to work with high hopes and soon had
excavated a complete circle around the sundial.
Dusk found them still digging. Finally, with an
exclamation of disgust, Madge threw down her
spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned,
the pearls may stay hidden until the end of time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; Cara added fervently. &ldquo;Just look at
the blisters on my hands. And my shoulder muscles
are sore already. What will they be like tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the way I feel is any indication, we&rsquo;ll both
be in the hospital. The next time I get one of my
so-called brilliant ideas, I hope you choke me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Cara promised gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>They filled in the earth they had disturbed and
went home in a very ill temper. A hot bath and a
warm supper cheered Madge considerably, causing
her to forget her resolution to think no more of
the pearls. That very evening she settled herself
in an easy chair, determined to reread Florence
Swenster&rsquo;s diary.</p>
<p>It was a tiresome ordeal now that the material
was no longer novel. Several times Madge yawned
wearily and was tempted to switch to a popular
magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is absolutely our last hope,&rdquo; she told herself,
gazing thoughtfully at the little leather book
in her hand. &ldquo;Miss Swenster&rsquo;s auction sale will
be held in a few days now, and after the place is
sold, it will be too late to help her. I suppose I&rsquo;m
crazy to keep kidding myself we may find the
pearls&mdash;especially, after our experience today.
Just the same I can&rsquo;t help feeling that I&rsquo;ve overlooked
some important clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She yawned again and went back to her reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will never do!&rdquo; she chided herself. &ldquo;My
mind isn&rsquo;t on it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned another page, read a few paragraphs
which she remembered perfectly. Then, unexpectedly,
her eye fastened upon a notation which
she and Cara had skipped during the first reading
of the diary. It was not particularly startling,
merely reading:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Uncle George is to mix cement for the new sundial
tomorrow.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Madge stared at it long and thoughtfully. She
felt it must have more significance than was apparent.
She began to recall scraps of information,
previously gleaned. Why had Florence Swenster
taken Uncle George into her confidence in regard
to the hiding of the pearls? It was unlikely that
she would trust such knowledge to him unless she
had need of his help.</p>
<p>She looked at the date of the notation to compare
it with the day Florence had recorded that
she had hidden the pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to this diary, Uncle George must
have been making the sundial on the very day that
the pearls were disposed of!&rdquo; she thought, with
growing excitement. &ldquo;And Uncle Ross said his
father mentioned the sundial. Oh, there&rsquo;s a very
significant connection!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge knew that she was on the verge of making
an important deduction, but try as she would
she could not solve the enigma. For fifteen minutes
she sat staring thoughtfully into space, trying to
work her way through the maze.</p>
<p>Then like a flash, the answer came. She sprang
to her feet, her face jubilant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me not to think of it before!
We&rsquo;ve had the clue all the time and didn&rsquo;t know it!
Tomorrow, if I can convince Miss Swenster to
my way of reasoning, I&rsquo;ll lead her to the pearls!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br /><i>The Stranger</i></h2>
<p>Madge waylaid Cara the following evening after
school, fairly dragging her down the street, so
great was her hurry to get away from the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going straight to the mansion,&rdquo; she announced
impressively.</p>
<p>Cara threw up her hands in a gesture of hopeless
despair and stopped dead in her tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another brilliant idea! I see it coming on.
Remember, you told me to choke you if you ever
had one again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This idea is different and it doesn&rsquo;t involve any
digging. It&rsquo;s worse than that. I&rsquo;m afraid Miss
Swenster won&rsquo;t consent. You must help me convince
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of herself, Cara&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convince her of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Madge ordered, catching her by
the hand and pulling her along. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t time
to explain now. You&rsquo;ll hear everything when we
reach the mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Miss Swenster received them with her usual
cordiality. Madge was so excited that as she
plumped herself down on the sofa, it was difficult
for her to begin. Briefly, she reviewed the facts
already known to Miss Swenster and Cara, then
disclosed the new notation she had found in the
diary. She was a little disappointed to observe
that neither appeared greatly impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see just what you have in mind,&rdquo; Miss
Swenster confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply this! Uncle George Jackson had a hand
in hiding the pearls. We know the sundial had
something to do with it too. Now, since the pearls
were hidden on the very day that the old Negro
was mixing cement for the sundial, it&rsquo;s my contention
that the necklace was hidden <i>inside</i> it,
probably in the pedestal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full minute, Miss Swenster digested this
in silence. Then she said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an interesting theory at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge cast a glance of despair at Cara. Everything
depended upon Miss Swenster&rsquo;s enthusiastic
acceptance of the idea. She was even more
discouraged to see that her chum regarded her
somewhat skeptically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can tell you both think it&rsquo;s another silly
idea. But you must admit it&rsquo;s logical. If only we
could have the sundial opened, I know we&rsquo;d find
the pearls!&rdquo; She arose, feeling that it was useless
to add more. Although Miss Swenster had said
little, Madge could tell that she did not care to have
the sundial broken. Nor could she really blame
her for the dial was a beautiful piece of work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Miss Swenster said firmly. &ldquo;There
may be something in what you say. At least, we&rsquo;ll
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we may have the sundial cracked
open?&rdquo; Madge demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>Miss Swenster nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, shall we go to the garden now and see
what must be done to remove the pedestal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped a shawl over her shoulders as a protection
against the fall winds and the girls followed
her outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion the pearls are hidden in the
base,&rdquo; Madge declared as they surveyed the sundial
speculatively. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a shame to ruin the
pedestal unless we&rsquo;re sure. Perhaps if we move
it a trifle, we may hear something rattling about
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three placed their shoulders to the pedestal,
trying to lift it. The sundial seemed rooted to
the ground, so little would it give.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too heavy for us,&rdquo; Miss Swenster said,
wiping the dust from her hands. &ldquo;We must have
it cracked open.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know a man who is very reasonable in his
charges,&rdquo; Madge informed quickly. &ldquo;Occasionally,
he does work for Uncle George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go for him now if you wish. It grows
dark very early these fall days. If we are to accomplish
anything today, we must lose no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge was only too eager to take herself upon
the errand. Since Cara, who never enjoyed long
walks, preferred to remain at the mansion with
Miss Swenster, she started off alone.</p>
<p>Silas Davies was the man she had in mind for
the work. He was always glad to pick up odd
jobs, and in case the pearls were not found, she
thought she could trust him to maintain a discreet
silence.</p>
<p>She had forgotten where he lived so stopped at
a corner drug store to consult a telephone directory.
Finding that the house was only a short distance
away, she decided to go there instead of calling.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she knocked at the door of
a neat, modest little house on Bancroft Street. A
woman answered, and Madge inquired if Mr.
Davies was home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s working for Mr. Ruggles today,&rdquo; his wife
returned regretfully. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m expecting him
home in three quarters of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s been working all day, I suppose it&rsquo;s too
late to get him to come to the Swenster mansion,&rdquo;
Madge murmured in discouragement. &ldquo;Miss
Swenster had a little job for him&mdash;it won&rsquo;t take
long but it&rsquo;s dreadfully important that it be done
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say how tired Mr. Davies will be.
He makes a point of not working after five but if
it&rsquo;s real urgent he may accommodate you. He&rsquo;ll be
at the Ruggles place for another half hour. Why
don&rsquo;t you stop there and see what he says?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge thanked Mrs. Davies, deciding to follow
the suggestion. It really was urgent that the sundial
be investigated that very afternoon. With
strangers prowling about the mansion at night, it
was not safe to leave anything to chance. If necessary,
she was willing to pay Mr. Davies out of her
own pocket for the extra service.</p>
<p>She walked hurriedly toward the Ruggles residence,
anxiously studying the western horizon
where the sun was sinking lower and lower. So
absorbed was she in her own thoughts that she
failed to observe the approach of a man who walked
swiftly, with head low and chin thrust deeply in
his coat collar. Inevitably, they collided.</p>
<p>For a brief instant they were face to face. Involuntarily,
Madge started, and an exclamation
scarcely above a whisper, escaped her.</p>
<p>It was the man she had seen many nights before
prowling about in Miss Swenster&rsquo;s garden!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br /><i>An Unexpected Meeting</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Better watch where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; the man
said gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Madge stammered,
unable to remove her eyes from his face.</p>
<p>For a moment they continued to stare, then the
man moved on. Madge looked after him, trying
to gather her scattered thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him before,&rdquo; she told herself tensely.
&ldquo;In Miss Swenster&rsquo;s garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watching the retreating figure, she was convinced
she had not been mistaken in her first hasty
conclusion. The man was none other than the
mysterious prowler. His build was the same; he
had a similar way of walking: everything tallied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not the only place I&rsquo;ve seen him,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Let me think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before her eyes flashed a mental picture of the
photograph she had seen hanging in Miss
Swenster&rsquo;s study. She recalled the youthful face,
the regular, almost classical features, a head of
curly, golden hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s changed some with the years,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie it&rsquo;s John Swenster. I
wonder if Miss Swenster knows he&rsquo;s in Claymore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a possibility seemed remote. Madge knew
that Miss Swenster was still so distressed by the
memory of her adopted son that his presence in
the city was almost certain to disturb her usual
calm manner. And during the past few days she
had seemed no different than usual.</p>
<p>She wondered what had brought the man to
Claymore. It was unlikely he had come to attend
the auction sale or to see his mother. His secret
trips to the garden suggested a deeper, more selfish
purpose.</p>
<p>Madge was inclined to hurry back to the mansion
to tell Miss Swenster the startling news. A
minute&rsquo;s thought convinced her that such a course
would be unwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one chance in a hundred that I&rsquo;m
mistaken,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;And if I should tell
Miss Swenster her son is here when it&rsquo;s some other
person, she might never get over the shock. No,
I must be absolutely sure before I say a word to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked after the retreating figure. He was
far up the street, walking swiftly, but she thought
she could overtake him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow and see where he goes,&rdquo; she decided.</p>
<p>She soon saw that he was heading toward the
business section of Claymore. Rapidly cutting
down the distance between them, she then kept just
far enough behind to avoid suspicion.</p>
<p>As they reached the downtown section, the
stranger walked faster, moving in and out to pass
pedestrians hurrying home from work. Madge
found it increasingly difficult to keep him in sight.</p>
<p>Then she lost him entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where he went unless he dodged
in somewhere,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>She gazed in through the window of a drug
store but could not locate him. The only other
possibility was the Grand Hotel. She went in.</p>
<p>The lobby was crowded. Madge looked carefully
about, observing no one who resembled the
man she sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if his name is on the register,&rdquo; she
decided.</p>
<p>Before she could transfer the thought to action,
an elevator discharged passengers. Several of
the men walked toward the main desk. And one
of them was the stranger Madge had followed.
He did not glance in her direction but moved
directly to where the clerk was standing.</p>
<p>Madge slipped behind a pillar and waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m checking out early this evening,&rdquo; she heard
him say tersely. &ldquo;I left my baggage upstairs but
I&rsquo;ll not be using the room after six. Please charge
me accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed within a few feet of where Madge
was standing, and walked out the front entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he&rsquo;ll not be snooping around the mansion
any more,&rdquo; she told herself with satisfaction.
&ldquo;And judging from the crabby way he acts, he
hasn&rsquo;t been very successful in his mission&mdash;whatever
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the man&rsquo;s back had vanished through the
revolving doors, she moved over to the desk, asking
to see the register. She glanced over the first
page of names and turned back. At last she came
to it: &ldquo;John Swenster, Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that proves I was right,&rdquo; Madge commented
inwardly. &ldquo;And now the problem is
whether or not to tell Miss Swenster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging from the hotel she was astonished to
see how dark it had grown. Consulting her watch,
she realized it was too late to find Silas Davies
at the Ruggles&rsquo;. Regretfully, she decided that she
must let the work on the sundial go for that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supper time now and Miss Swenster and
Cara will be wondering what became of me,&rdquo; she
thought uncomfortably. &ldquo;Aunt Maude will be in
my wool too if I don&rsquo;t scamper home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>A few minutes later, breathless from hurrying
so fast, she let herself in the front gate of the
mansion and rushed up the walk. Cara, who had
been watching at a window for the past half
hour, flung open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all this time?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you bring the workman after
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Madge apologized, flashing her a significant
look which Cara did not understand.
&ldquo;Other matters came up. Anyway, Mr. Davies
was working at the Ruggles&rsquo;. I imagine we can
get him tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara was disappointed and disclosed it. She
brightened when Miss Swenster suggested that
both girls remain for supper. It was not difficult
to persuade Madge, for she felt that she should
tell Miss Swenster what she had discovered, and
she preferred time to lead up to the matter gradually.</p>
<p>The girls telephoned to their homes, receiving
permission to remain. They helped Miss Swenster
with the supper, setting the table, and taking great
pains with the salad which was their own concoction.</p>
<p>It was nearly seven-thirty when they sat down
to dine. For some reason, conversation lagged.
Miss Swenster appeared unusually constrained
though she made a studied attempt at cheerfulness.
No one ate very much. It was in the minds of all
that this likely would be their last supper together.
In a few days the mansion would be sold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you weren&rsquo;t going away, Miss
Swenster,&rdquo; Cara said presently. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t seem
right for any other person to live in this lovely
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster smiled, but tears shone in her
eyes. She brushed them impatiently away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sentimental old fool I am! Here I&rsquo;ve
not lived in this house for eight years but now
that I know I&rsquo;m to lose it, I feel so desolate. It&rsquo;s
almost as though I&rsquo;m losing my last friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a great many friends here in Claymore,&rdquo;
Madge assured her, &ldquo;only they&rsquo;re timid
about coming to see you. I&rsquo;ve heard folks say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Miss Swenster agreed
slowly. &ldquo;There was a time when I didn&rsquo;t care to
see people. I couldn&rsquo;t bear their sympathy. I
drove them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed into a moody silence which neither
of the girls ventured to break. Presently, she
looked up and smiled apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t impose my troubles on you. I&rsquo;m
sure that at times my actions must have seemed
very queer. I feel I owe you an explanation for
certain things which likely are not clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your past is your own,&rdquo; Madge said kindly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us anything that you dislike to bring
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel I must speak of my&mdash;my son. It was his
picture you saw in the study. I turned it to the
wall on the day I closed up the mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge and Cara nodded, not wishing to interrupt.
They already had guessed this much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found John in an orphan&rsquo;s home. He was
nine when I adopted him, and the sweetest boy
in the world! Oh, I adored him! But even as a
boy he was inclined to get into trouble. He&rsquo;d take
things that didn&rsquo;t belong to him. I couldn&rsquo;t seem
to teach him the difference between right and
wrong. Oh, I dislike to admit it, but he was willful
and he repaid my kindness with indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him away to school, thinking he might
benefit by a change in environment. Once away
from my watchful eye, he went from bad to worse.
He fell in with the wrong sort of companions. He
spent far more money than I could afford to give
him. Several times he forged my name to checks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, I told him that if he did not straighten
up I should disown him. For a time he seemed to
do better. I was encouraged. Then he forged
another check&mdash;this time using the name of a
prominent Claymore man. I&rsquo;ll not bore you with
the details. It was the end. I sent him away and
I&rsquo;ve never seen him to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve forgiven him?&rdquo; Madge asked softly.</p>
<p>Miss Swenster did not reply at once. Then she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved John more than any other person in the
world, but it was a wasted love. I realize that
should I take him back he would only make me unhappy.
If he were to step into this house this
very night, I&rsquo;d tell him to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge gazed at her queerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really mean that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it may sound hard, but I gave twenty
years of my life to John. For the first time I am
commencing to see him in his true colors, ungilded
by my ideals. I can never hope to forget him entirely,
but at least his memory becomes more bearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge was sorely troubled. She had fully intended
to tell Miss Swenster that her son was in
Claymore. Now it seemed a cruel thing to do. By
her own admission, the old lady was gradually
casting off unhappy memories which had held her
enslaved for so many years. She felt herself sufficiently
strong to confront her son, yet Madge
wondered. Might not it be better to say nothing?
By tomorrow John Swenster would be far away
with no one the wiser, providing she kept her own
counsel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>She was still turning the matter over in her
mind when they left the supper table. The girls
cleared the table and wiped dishes. Madge dropped
a plate which fortunately did not break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you tonight?&rdquo; Cara asked. &ldquo;Are
you worrying about that French quiz we had
today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it might be better if I would worry a
little. I flunked it flat I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always say that, but at the end of the
month I notice you manage to squeeze through
pretty well at the head of the list!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They finished drying the dishes and stacked
them in the cupboard. Madge was putting away
the last plate when she suddenly straightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; Cara returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard something fall to the ground.
It sounded like it came from the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re imagining things,&rdquo; Cara laughed. &ldquo;Did
you hear anything, Miss Swenster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. It might have been a ladder that
fell. The man who was working on the house
yesterday, left one standing against the eaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not look completely convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might just run out and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose!&rdquo; Cara remonstrated. &ldquo;I
think it was your imagination. We&rsquo;re too far
away from the garden to hear any noise from
there. It was probably the ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge allowed her chum to drag her into the
living room. She went to the window and looked
out. It was a black night but had there been a
moon she could not have seen the garden for a
wing of the house obstructed the view. The wind
howled plaintively outside. Miss Swenster thought
the room was cold and went to the kitchen for fire-wood.</p>
<p>They built a cheerful little blaze in the fireplace.
Madge and Cara sat on the floor, watching the
embers. Presently, Miss Swenster brought in
marshmallows which they toasted above the coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Cara warned. &ldquo;Yours is burning,
Madge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge flung the charred marshmallow into the
fire and abruptly arose. She slipped on her coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Cara demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just out to the garden. I want to satisfy
my curiosity. I&rsquo;ve had an uneasy feeling all evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cara laughed scoffingly but when she saw her
friend was not to be dissuaded, she too arose.
Miss Swenster reached for her shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well all go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I feel that
fresh air would do me good too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>They filed out the front way, Madge leading.
She was the first to reach the garden. Uttering a
cry of surprise and alarm, she ran to the sundial.</p>
<p>It lay upon its side and the pedestal had been
split from the dial!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br /><i>The Secret in Stone</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed,
gazing in dismay at the wreckage. &ldquo;All evening
I felt something like this was about to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the wind blew it over,&rdquo; Miss Swenster
said, though her voice disclosed that she had no
faith in her own words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have taken a cyclone to move that
heavy sundial,&rdquo; Madge declared. &ldquo;Someone deliberately
cracked it open. See, here&rsquo;s the sledge-hammer
he used. I knew I heard some such
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And like as not the pearls are gone!&rdquo; Cara
wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion,&rdquo; Madge responded.
&ldquo;But we may as well get a light and
make a thorough search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster already had started for the
house. She returned a minute later with a flashlight.
They turned it upon the dark interior of
the broken pedestal and Madge felt around with
her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the pearls were ever here they&rsquo;re gone now,&rdquo;
she announced.</p>
<p>The significance of the discovery was gradually
dawning upon her. She knew that it was John
Swenster who had been prowling about the garden
and now she was convinced that he had broken
open the sundial in an attempt to locate the pearls.
At the risk of shocking Miss Swenster, she determined
to withhold her information no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Swenster, I should have told you this before,&rdquo;
she said quietly. &ldquo;Your son is in Claymore&mdash;has
been for days. I learned this afternoon
that he had registered at the Grand Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster&rsquo;s face was hidden by the darkness
but the girls saw her figure straighten. She
spoke no word and Madge rushed recklessly on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought not to say this, but I discovered
that it was he who came here at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prowler you saw digging here in the
garden?&rdquo; Miss Swenster asked in a tense, unnatural
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think we know what became of the
pearls. You should have told me before, Madge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did intend to&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Miss Swenster interrupted,
&ldquo;you hoped to spare my feelings. We must try to
reach my son at once!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s registered at the hotel, but I&rsquo;m afraid
he may be gone by this time. I heard him say
he was checking out early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him get away with the pearls!
Come, we&rsquo;ll call a taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rushed to the house. While Madge and
Cara struggled into their wraps, Miss Swenster
telephoned the nearest cab agency. In five minutes
the taxi was at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Grand Hotel,&rdquo; Miss Swenster directed,
&ldquo;and hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dim light of the cab she looked very pale
but determined. She listened quietly as Madge
related in detail her experience of the afternoon.</p>
<p>The cab halted in front of the hotel and the
doorman assisted them to alight. Telling the
driver to wait, the three hurried inside, going
directly to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should like to see Mr. Swenster,&rdquo; Madge
said. &ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk shook his head regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. He checked out some time ago. He
went at least a half hour ago, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where he was going?&rdquo; Madge
demanded eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might inquire of the starter,&rdquo; the clerk
suggested. &ldquo;I believe Mr. Swenster called a taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The three hurried outside again, asking the
same question of the doorman. He did not know
Mr. Swenster by name but recalled him from
Madge&rsquo;s accurate description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I remember rightly, he went to the Union
depot,&rdquo; he informed.</p>
<p>They sprang into the waiting cab, directing the
driver to take them to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step on it!&rdquo; Madge ordered.</p>
<p>She glanced at her wrist watch. It was exactly
nine-thirty and she knew that an express train
left for New York at nine-forty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll never make it!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Miss Swenster&rsquo;s lips drew down into a tighter
line. Her fingers nervously tapped the car window.</p>
<p>They had three minutes to spare as the cab
pulled up to the station. Tumbling out, they
started off at a run, unaware of the curious stares
directed at them.</p>
<p>Entering the waiting room, they swiftly surveyed
it. John Swenster was no where to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably on the train by this time!&rdquo; Cara
cried. &ldquo;And it pulls out in two minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster and Madge dragged her toward
the gate. &ldquo;Tickets!&rdquo; the gateman said sternly.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go in without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three brushed past him so quickly that he
was taken completely by surprise, and could only
stare after their retreating backs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>They ran down the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Madge cried, pointing to a man ahead.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s John,&rdquo; Miss Swenster murmured.</p>
<p>They touched him on the shoulder just as he was
boarding the train. He wheeled and the color
drained from his face as he beheld Miss Swenster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;&rdquo; her voice quavered, then took on a
sterner tone. &ldquo;You must come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m taking this train.&rdquo; He tried
to board it but Cara deliberately blocked his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go until you explain a number of
things,&rdquo; Miss Swenster said quietly. &ldquo;And you
must give me the pearls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the idiotic things! Say, are you
trying to create a scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With increasing uneasiness, he surveyed a little
group of persons who had gathered on the platform
to see what the argument was about. Passengers
had thrust their heads curiously from the
train windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; the conductor called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way!&rdquo; John Swenster said
harshly, thrusting Cara aside.</p>
<p>Madge darted forward, snatching his suitcase
from his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you go, you go without your suitcase!
And what&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;ll have you arrested
at the first stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man faced Madge with smoldering eyes.
He saw that he could not retrieve his suitcase
without a struggle and the conductor was not in
sufficient sympathy to hold the train a minute.
Even now it was slowly pulling from the station.</p>
<p>Frantically, he watched the cars moving by. He
seemed undecided what to do. Then with a gesture
of angry submission, he abandoned all intention
of boarding the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that you&rsquo;ve made me miss my train,
just what do you want?&rdquo; he asked unpleasantly,
moving toward Madge as if to recover his suitcase.</p>
<p>She backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, John,&rdquo; Miss Swenster said firmly, &ldquo;unless
you wish me to call the police, you must come
without making any fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you expect me to go?&rdquo; he demanded
sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my home. We&rsquo;ll talk matters over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check my
suitcase and go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the suitcase along,&rdquo; Miss Swenster
told him.</p>
<p>He looked as though he intended to refuse, but
the sight of a policeman moving through the train
gate, caused him to change his mind. Madge and
Cara carried the suitcase to a taxi cab, not trusting
it in his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; John Swenster protested
as they drove toward the mansion.</p>
<p>His foster-mother paid scant attention. Not
until they were all in the living room of the mansion
did she speak her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood entirely too
much at your hands. I&rsquo;ve protected you for the
last time. Now either give up the pearls or I&rsquo;ll
turn you over to the authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pearls!&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything
about your pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madge, will you search the suitcase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had been waiting for this opportunity.
Quickly, while John Swenster looked on furiously,
they unstrapped the case and opened it. They
lifted out several layers of clothing. In the very
bottom, lay an old candy box. Madge shook it.
Something rattled. She opened the box.</p>
<p>Inside lay a string of pearls, perfect in shape,
skillfully matched&mdash;the most beautiful necklace
the girls had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The famous old Swenster pearls that were
willed to my mother!&rdquo; Miss Swenster exclaimed.
She turned coldly to her adopted son, &ldquo;And you
would have stolen them from me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>A sudden change had come over the man. At
sight of the pearls which plainly established his
guilt, his arrogance departed. He gazed contritely
upon his foster mother. Madge instantly divined
that he hoped to appeal to her sympathies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would never have touched your pearls only
I&rsquo;m in such desperate need,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
find work. Why, I haven&rsquo;t had a decent meal in
weeks. I&rsquo;m down and out while you have this
fine home&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a rather appealing figure as he stood
there pleading his case. Madge and Cara exchanged
uneasy glances. Would Miss Swenster
give in to him as she had in the past?</p>
<p>The old lady seemed to waver. Her face softened,
then tightened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try your old tactics,&rdquo; she said sternly.
&ldquo;I notice that you have good clothing and you had
money enough to stay at the Grand Hotel. However,
I&rsquo;ll be generous. If you care to make your
home here you are free to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;d stay in this one-horse town? Not
on your life! You must furnish me with money
to live in Chicago or New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not get another cent from me&mdash;ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Swenster shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. Then I&rsquo;ll be ambling along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One minute!&rdquo; Miss Swenster halted him. &ldquo;I am
letting you off easier than you deserve. By rights
I should turn you over to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re being very generous!&rdquo; he mocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you tell me exactly what motivated your
return to Claymore&mdash;and a truthful story, mind
you&mdash;I may change my mind about being so generous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Swenster recognized that she meant what
she said. He realized too that her feeling toward
him had undergone a change, that he could no
longer bend her to his will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little to tell,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;I was
out of money and I thought the pearls might tide
me over. I&rsquo;d have had &rsquo;em too if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
these girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you learn of the pearls?&rdquo; Miss
Swenster questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew about them when I was a boy. Remember
that old desk of yours? Well, it has a secret
panel. There&rsquo;s a diary inside that told about the
pearls. I tore out one of the pages years ago and
then forgot about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what did that page say about the pearls?&rdquo;
Madge inquired curiously. &ldquo;Did it say they were
hidden in the sundial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it didn&rsquo;t. If it had, I&rsquo;d have made off with
them weeks ago. The only hint I had was that
they were hidden somewhere near the sundial.
Like a fool I wasted a lot of time digging up the
garden!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saw you,&rdquo; Madge admitted. &ldquo;But tell us,
what brought you here just at this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was years ago I learned about the pearls. I
tried to locate them at the time but failed. Then
I forgot all about it until I learned that Miss
Swenster was coming back here to open up the
house. I thought I&rsquo;d get here first and make one
more try. I didn&rsquo;t have any luck until it occurred
to me that the pearls might have been hidden inside
the dial. Tonight I came here, chancing detection,
and cracked open the pedestal. I found the necklace
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Swenster asked a few more questions before
telling her son that he might feel free to go.
After he had left, she stood for some minutes at
the window, watching his retreating figure. Then
she turned back to the girls, and with tears in her
eyes thanked them for their aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved my house!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Finding
the pearls means more to me than you&rsquo;ll ever
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so late that Cara and Madge dared linger
no longer. However, the following day they were
back at the mansion to learn from Miss Swenster
that she had called off her auction sale. Already
she was making plans to restore the estate to its
former elegance and she had engaged old Uncle
Ross as gardener. She told them too, that she had
turned over the necklace to a jeweler for an appraisal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know its value yet,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;but
it will bring more than enough to keep me in my
old age. I intend to reward you girls too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge and Cara demurred and Miss Swenster
finally dropped the subject after warning them she
would have something more to say when their
birthdays arrived. Nevertheless, the girls did have
one favor to ask&mdash;that they might hold a meeting
of Skull and Crossbones at the old mansion.</p>
<p>The very next Saturday Madge and Cara introduced
their friends to the delightful estate. They
pointed out the broken sundial which Miss
Swenster planned to repair, the desk with the secret
panel, and told a story which held their friends
spellbound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lucky thing,&rdquo; Jane Allen said enviously to
Madge. &ldquo;How do you manage to run into all these
entrancing adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to run into me,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair for you to have a corner on all
the fun,&rdquo; Enid Burnett complained good naturedly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not forgive you unless you promise to take
us in on your next secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall,&rdquo; Madge returned, &ldquo;though I can&rsquo;t
say when I&rsquo;ll have another. If only you&rsquo;d all go
North with me next summer, I know I could guarantee
real fun and perhaps an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take her up on it!&rdquo; Enid cried.</p>
<p>The girls all laughed for as they sat in the cozy
drawing room before the crackling fire, summer
seemed a long way off and Canada too far distant
to even imagine. Yet, the germ had taken root,
and the next year was to see them all in the North
Woods with Madge fulfilling her pledge.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
